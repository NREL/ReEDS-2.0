# Hourlize

## Overview
Hourlize processes hourly resource and load data into ReEDS inputs. The vision is for this module to allow maximum flexibility
temporally and spatially.

Hourlize is run by a call to `run_hourlize.py`, which assembles information on the cases to run and then executes a call to either
 `resource.py` and `load.py`. The `run_hourlize.py` script can be used to set up jobs to submit to the HPC to run in parallel or to run hourlize jobs directly in sequence. 

### Quickstart: Resource
1. Copy any new reV supply curves to the supply curve folder and update the rev_paths file ([details](#setup-for-rev-supply-curves)).
1. Update settings in `config_base.json` as needed ([details](#config-jsons)).
1. Update settings in the relevant `config_[tech].json` files as needed ([details](#config-jsons)).
1. Specify cases to run in `cases.json` or create your own cases file ([details](#cases-json)).
1. If running on the HPC, specify run allocation or other submission settings in `hourlize/inputs/configs/srun_template.sh` ([details](#config-jsons)).
1. Run using `run_hourlize.py resource` ([details](#running-hourlize)). 
1. Sync up new supply curve files on HPC, nrelnas01, and Yampa as needed

### Quickstart: Load
1. Update settings in `config_base.json` as needed ([details](#config-jsons)).
1. If running on the HPC, specify run allocation or other submission settings in `inputs/configs/srun_template.sh` ([details](#config-jsons)).
1. Run using `run_hourlize.py load` ([details](#running-hourlize)). 

For more details and run options see further below.

## Setup for reV supply curves

If you don't have new reV supply curves you can probably skip this section and go down to [running hourlize](#running-hourlize). However, if you are planning on pushing your supply curve outputs to the repo don't forget to [sync the shared directories](#4-synchronize-shared-directories).

#### 1. Copy reV runs to reeds shared directory

Before running resource hourlize the reV runs should be copied from their original location to the shared folder. Currently reV data used in ReEDS (along with hourlize inputs and outputs) are stored in three places:
* on the nrelnas01 device at `\\nrelnas01\ReEDS\Supply_Curve_Data`
* on Eagle at `/shared-projects/reeds/Supply_Curve_Data`
* on Kestrel at `/kfs2/shared-projects/reeds/Supply_Curve_Data`

Under the appropriate tech folder (UPV, ONSHORE, OFFSHORE, etc.) create a directory with a descrptive name for the supply curves (e.g., 2023_06_06_Update). Then copy the reV supply curves and profiles into a folder called `reV`. A good approach is to use rsync; below is an example copying original reV files from Eagle to Kestrel:

```
rsync -aPu [username]@eagle.hpc.nrel.gov://shared-projects/rev/projects/seto/fy23/rev/standard_scenarios/aggregation/  /projects/shared-projects-reeds/reeds/Supply_Curve_Data/UPV/2023_06_06_Update/reV
```

#### 2. Update the rev_paths files

Update the reV paths file at `ReEDS-2.0/inputs/supply_curve/rev_paths.csv`. Typically this means updating the information for whichever techs (e.g., upv, wind-ons, wind-ofs) and access cases (e.g., reference, open, limited) you want to run. 

Some details on the additional columns to update:
- `sc_path`: path to the supply curve folder on the shared drive; should be of the format tech/update_name (e.g. UPV/2023_06_06_Update, ONSHORE/2023_07_28_Update).
- `rev_case`: name of the reV case to be used for this scenario; this should reference a directory in the "reV" folder with the sc_path (e.g., if 02_limited is one of the rev_case values for upv, then there should be a folder called UPV/2023_06_06_Update/reV/02_limited).
- `original_sc_file`: path to the original reV supply curve csv file (i.e., before hourlize pre-processing). Specified relative to the "reV" folder within the corresponding sc_path. 
- `original_rev_folder`: full path of the original location of the supply curves passed by the reV team. Not actively used but useful for debugging issues with the reV runs.
- `cf_path`: full path to the generation file used for the reV runs. This can typically be found in the `config_aggregation.json` file from the reV run as `gen_fpath`. An exception is for bespoke wind runs, in which case this should point to the reV profiles. Needed for R2P.

#### 3. Run hourlize

Follow setup details [here](#running-hourlize).

Hourlize relies on a set of columns being in the reV supply curve. In some cases hourlize can fill in missing columns hourlize in a pre-processing step, but in others these missing columns can cause hourlize to fall. A list of required columns can be found in `hourlize/inputs/resource/rev_sc_columns.csv`


#### 4. Synchronize shared directories

By default hourlize will copy the required files in your ReEDS repository (`copy_to_reeds=True`). You can also copy the hourlize outputs back to the shared repository by setting `copy_to_shared=True`. 

Note that hourlize copies to only one of the shared locations (either the HPC or nrelnas01, depending on where you are running it), so even with `copy_to_shared=True` you'll want to sync up the two shared folders. When starting from the HPC, be sure to open up permissions to the supply curve outputs you've just created (e.g., `chmod -R 777 UPV/2023_06_06_Update`). Then, from your local computer, use WinSCP or rsync to copy the files from Kestrel to nrelnas01:

```
rsync -aPu [username]@kestrel.nrel.gov://projects/shared-projects-reeds/reeds/Supply_Curve_Data/UPV/2023_11_02_LandCover /Volumes/ReEDS/Supply_Curve_Data/UPV
```

## Running hourlize
 
### run_hourlize.py 
The `run_hourlize.py` script serves as a wrapper for calling either `load.py` or `resource.py`. It does the following:
* Collect run(s) configuration settings from the relevant config files to build a consolidated config file for each run.
* Runs formatting on config file entries. 
  * Entries with {variable} in the text will have the {variable} text replaced with the value referenced by 'variable', which typically refers to another config entry or a file path.
  * Entries with {eval_expression} will evaluate 'expression' as a python expression; useful for creating lists using ranges.
  * Combines all configs into a single config.json sent to resource.py.
* Creates an output folder for the supply curve run in `hourlize/out/[casename]`, where casename is defined in the `cases.json file`.
* Creates a .sh or .bat script to run the case with a call to `resource.py`.
* Optionally submits jobs to the HPC or initiates the runs directly.

Example calls:
```
python run_hourlize.py load                  # run load.py
python run_hourlize.py resource              # run resource.py with default cases
python run_hourlize.py resource -c suffix    # run resource.py with cases from cases_suffix.json
python run_hourlize.py resource --local      # if on HPC run all cases sequentially on current node without batch submission to slurm
python run_hourlize.py resource --nosubmit   # if on HPC create launch scripts and input folders but don't submit runs
```
To see details on all command line arguments run `python run_hourlize.py -h`.

After setting up the run, if specified `run_hourlize.py` will launch the .sh or .bat file which performs the following call to `resource.py`: 
```
python resource.py --config /path/to/hourlize/[casename]/inputs/config.json
```

### Config jsons

Hourlize uses a set of json config files to provide information on how to process the supply curves. These files are located in `hourlize/inputs/configs`: 
* **Cases file** (`cases.json`): list of resource cases to run (currently not applicable to load.py)
* **Tech config** (`config_[tech].json`): tech specific settings for the `resource.py` script for upv, wind-ons, and wind-ofs 
* **Base config** (`config_base.json`): general hourlize settings (shared) as well as specific settings for the resource and load processes  

The `run_hourlize.py` process will generate a final config (`config.json`) from the relevant base and tech configs for each run, as depicted in the figure below. In general the settings in the `cases.json` file unique to each run while the settings in the tech and base configs aren't frequently changed. In the case of duplicated entries across configs hourlize uses the following order of precedence: cases > tech > base. 

![hourlize_configs](https://media.github.nrel.gov/user/1374/files/e4c990fa-fa12-47c2-9b0c-0d7bdbc255d0)

The `srun_template.sh` file is used to govern HPC submission settings. Update with your allocation, email, and any other slurm specifications before submitting jobs. There is also a command line argument to via `run_hourlize.py` for running jobs using the debug partition.

For more details on the meaning of the different config settings see the tables at the bottom of this README ([link](#details-on-config-file-settings)).

### Cases json

The cases json provides a list of resource supply curve cases to process. The default cases file (`case.json`) includes all supply curves typically needed for ReEDS for BA- and county-resolution runs. Users can also build their own cases file of the format `cases_[case_suffix].json`. 

Each entry should be given a `casename` for the supply curve run in the format [`tech`]\_[`access_case`]\_[`resolution`].
* Supported values for `tech`: upv, wind-ofs, wind-ons.
* Supported values for `resolution`: ba, county.
  * Make sure the entry for `resolution` aligns with the `reg_out_col` entry (ba: "ba", county: "cnty_fips").
* Typical values for `access_case`: reference, open, or limited.
  * Other values allowed but must match values in `access_case` column of the rev_paths file (typically at `ReEDS-2.0/inputs/supply_curve/rev_paths.csv` but can be specified in `config_base.json`). 

To link a case to a custom set of config files users can add entries for `config_base` and `config_tech` in the case defintion. For example, adding `config_base:test` would link that case to the settings in `config_base_test.json` instead of the typical `config_base.json` file.

Other key/value pairs in the `cases.json` file can also be used as subsetting variables for downselecting relevant rows from the corresponding rev_paths file. This can helpful when running hourlize for cases that don't just differ by access and tech. To use this add the key/value pair from the rev_paths_file to the relevant cases and to the list of `subsetvars` in the base config.

The current `cases.json` file in the repository contains all the settings to run the supply curves currently maintained by ReEDS. 

### Tips

* If you want the hourlize runs to be copied back the shared supply curve folder, set `copy_to_shared = true`.
  * Note: this script currently only copies to one of the shared folders (the HPC or nrelnas01), so you'll need to sync up the two after copying.
* By default hourlize is set up to copy outputs into the ReEDS repo (`copy_to_reeds = true`).
* `reg_out_col`  is typically either 'ba' for ReEDS regions or 'cnty_fips' for county-level supply curves, but can also be set to any column in the file specified by `reg_map_path` (which will be merged to the supply curve file by county fips code) or to a column in the supply curve file itself.

## Resource Logic (resource.py)
### Inputs
The main inputs to hourlize are reV outputs for a given reV scenario:
* `sc_path` (in rev_paths.csv): a supply curve csv file for a given technology, with rows for each resource site and columns of metadata.
* `rev_path` (in rev_paths.csv): A directory that contains h5 file(s) with hourly generation profiles for each site of the supply curve file for weather years 2007-2013.

### Outputs
By default, the outputs will be dumped to a subdirectory named `results` within `hourlize/out/[casename]`. In addition, with `copy_to_reeds` set to true (as is default), we'll copy the results to the ReEDS repo containing this hourlize directory, and with`copy_to_shared` set to true (not default), we'll copy to the shared drive (see Shared Drive Locations below).

* `{tech}_supply_curve.csv`: A supply curve with rows for each site and columns for region, class, available capacity, and costs. E.g. see `inputs/supply_curve/wind-ons_supply_curve-reference_ba.csv` (within ReEDS repo)
* `{tech}_exog_cap.csv`: Exogenous (built pre-2010) capacity with columns for region, site and year. This is not capacity builds in each year, but rather cumulative capacity of each existing site over time. E.g. see `inputs/capacity_exogenous/wind-ons_exog_cap_reference_ba.csv` (within ReEDS repo)
* `{tech}_prescribed_builds.csv`: Capacity prescribed builds (2010 - present) with columns for region, year, capacity. This is the installed capacity in each year rather than cumulative capacity over time. E.g. see `inputs/capacity_exogenous/wind-ons_prescribed_builds_reference_ba.csv` (within ReEDS repo)
* `{tech}_.h5`: Hourly capacity factor profiles for each region/class. See `inputs/variability/multi_year/wind-ons-reference_ba.h5` within the ReEDS repository as an example. These files include datasets with column names (class|region) and an index with datetime and timezone information. 

### Shared Drive Locations
Hourlize resource inputs and outputs in the same places as the copies of the reV supply curves (see details [here](#1-copy-rev-runs-to-reeds-shared-directory)). Whereas the reV supply curves are stored within a folder called `reV`, the hourlize runs can be found directly in the corresponding tech folder (e.g., UPV, OFFSHORE, ONSHORE).

### Logic
The `resource.py` script follows the following logic (in order of execution):
1. `get_supply_curve_and_preprocess()`
    - The supply curve is filtered if necessary, based on `filter_cols`.
    - A 'region' column is added to the supply curve and filled with the selected regionality (`reg_out_col`).
    - Existing sites from a generator database (`existing_sites`) are assigned to supply curve points for exogenous and prescribed capacity outputs.
    - If we have minimum capacity thresholds for the supply curve points, these are applied to further filter the supply curve.
1. `add_classes()`
    - A 'class' column is added to the supply curve and filled with the associated class. Classes can be based on statically defined conditions for columns in the supply curve (`class_path`). Otherwise (or layered on top of static class definitions), dynamic classes can be assigned (`class_bin`=true) using a binning method (`class_bin_method`, e.g. "kmeans"), a number of bins (`class_bin_num`), and the supply curve column to bin (`class_bin_col`). The binning logic itself is in `get_bin()`. The current default classes for onshore wind and utility-scale PV are based on national k-means clustering of average annual capacity factor (where higher class number corresponds with higher annual CF). Offshore wind, by contrast, uses statically defined classes from `hourlize/inputs/resource/wind-ofs_resource_classes.csv`.
1. `add_cost()`
    - A column of overall supply curve costs is added to the supply curve (`supply_curve_cost_per_mw`), as well as certain components of that cost (e.g. `trans_adder_per_mw` and `capital_adder_per_mw`). Logic for these costs depends on `tech`, and the value of `cost_out` in config (e.g. `combined_eos_trans` for onshore wind).
    - A column of overall supply curve costs is added to the supply curve (`supply_curve_cost_per_mw`), as well as certain components of that cost (e.g. `trans_adder_per_mw` and `capital_adder_per_mw`). Logic for these costs depends on `tech`, and the value of `cost_out` in config (e.g. `combined_eos_trans` for onshore wind).
1. `save_sc_outputs()`
    - Supply curve outputs are saved (`{tech}_supply_curve.csv`) as well as exogenous capacity (`{tech}_exog_cap.csv`), which is built pre-2010, and prescribed builds (`{tech}_prescribed_builds.csv`), which are built between 2010 and present day.
1. `get_profiles_allyears_weightedave()`
    - The hourly generation profiles are gathered, and capacity-weighted average profiles are calculated for each region/class.
1. `shift_timezones()`
    - Profiles are updated to `output_timezone` by making use of datetime index. Hours at the end of a year are "rolled" to the beginning of the first year in the contiguous set. Because the reV data drops Dec 31 on leap years, timezone adjusted data is modified for these years to be Dec 30.
1. `save_time_outputs()`
    - Weighted average profiles by region/class are saved to a `{tech}.h5` file. This method makes use of the same h5 format specified in the `write_profile_to_h5` function used by `ldc_prep.py` in ReEDS.
1. `map_supplycurve()`
    - Create output maps for supply curve
1. `copy_outputs()`
    - Copy outputs from the new directory within hourlize/out to the corresponding input files in the ReEDS repo (`copy_to_reeds`) and/or shared drive (`copy_to_shared`)

## Load Logic (load.py, THIS SECTION IS OUTDATED)
* Hourly PLEXOS region load data is first converted into ReEDS BA-level data by `plexos_to_reeds/plexos_to_reeds.py`
   * See `plexos_to_reeds/README.md` for more details
1. If specified, we reduce the hourly data to one year.
1. If specified, we remove the final day from leap years.
1. If specified, we shift the data into local time of each BA.
1. If specified, we calibrate each year of hourly data to EIA 2010 load data by state combined with load participation factors by BA. These load participation factors are from heritage ReEDS load inputs, which I believe were derived from Ventyx 2006 county-level load data.
1. For each BA we calculate average load by timeslice and peak load by season.
1. The load profiles, means by timeslice, and peaks by season are sent to a new folder in `out/`
* Current inputs and outputs are stored here: `\\nrelnas01\ReEDS\Supply_Curve_Data\LOAD\`
