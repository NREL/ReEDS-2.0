        Years to disaggregate. Typically from get_reeds_years().
    tech_lifetimes : pandas.DataFrame
        Defines lifetimes of technology (i.e., time to retirement or refurbishment).
        Columns include: [TODO].
    constrain_to_bins : bool, optional
        If True (default), disaggregation of new and pre-exising capacity will be
        constrained by region, class, and bin. If False, disaggregation will only be
        constrained by region and class. The latter option will result in greater
        flexibility of the disaggregation, but less fidelity to the ReEDS results, and
        is intended primarily for sensitivity testing or bounding scenarios.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        Results of disaggregation. Each row represents a reV supply curve project site
        for a given year. Columns describe input information about the project site and
        capacity deployed to that project site. Output columns  include input
        attributes (["sc_gid", "sc_point_gid", "latitude", "longitude",  "region",
        "class", "bin", "cap_avail", "supply_curve_cost_per_mw"]) and outputs from
        disaggregation (["cap_expand", "cap_left", "cap", "inv_rsc", "ret",  "refurb",

    """
    Performs the actual disaggregation of capacity from ReEDS regions to reV supply
    curve project sites. Loops through years and determines the investment
    in each supply curve point in each year. Investments are determined by filling up
    all supply curve points in the associated region, class, and (optionally)
    bin simultaneously until total capacity is built.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df_sc_in : pandas.DataFrame
        Modified/simplified version of the technology supply curve.
        All supply curve rows are present but only a subset of the columns are present,
        including: ["sc_gid", "sc_point_gid", "latitude", "longitude", "region",
        "class", "bin", "cap_avail"] plus any priority columns specified by the input
        ``priority`` (e.g., "supply_curve_cost_per_mw").
    df_ret : pandas.DataFrame
        Defines the retirements of capacity by year, region, and class.
        Columns include: ["year", "region", "class", "MW"].
    df_refurbishments : pandas.DataFrame
        Defines the refurbishments of capacity by year, region, and class.
        Columns include: ["year", "region", "class", "MW"].
    df_new_and_preexisting_investments : pandas.DataFrame
        Defines the new and pre-existing deployments of capacity by year, region, class,
        and resource bin. Columns include: ["year", "region", "class", "bin", "MW"].
    df_cap_chk : pandas.DataFrame
        Defines the aggregate capacity by year, region and class.
        Columns include: ["year", "region", "class", "MW"]. Used for a soft check of
        the disaggregation results. If ``None``, the soft check will not be performed.
    years : list[int]
        Years to disaggregate. Typically from get_reeds_years().
    constrain_to_bins : bool, optional
        If True (default), disaggregation of new and pre-exising capacity will be
        constrained by region, class, and bin. If False, disaggregation will only be
        constrained by region and class. The latter option will result in greater
        flexibility of the disaggregation, but less fidelity to the ReEDS results, and
        is intended primarily for sensitivity testing or bounding scenarios.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        Results of disaggregation. Each row represents a reV supply curve project site
        for a given year. Columns describe input information about the project site and
        capacity deployed to that project site. Output columns  include input
        attributes (["sc_gid", "sc_point_gid", "latitude", "longitude",  "region",
        "class", "bin", "cap_avail", "supply_curve_cost_per_mw"]) and outputs from
        disaggregation (["cap_expand", "cap_left", "cap", "inv_rsc", "ret",  "refurb",
        "expanded", "year"]).
