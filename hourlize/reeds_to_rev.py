    df_cap_chk : pandas.DataFrame

        Columns include: ["year", "region", "class", "MW"]. Used for a soft check of

    priority : dictionary
        Dictionary specifying which columns will be used to prioritize sites for
        disaggregation within each region/class/bin. Keys should be column names, values
        should be either "ascending" or "descending". For example, to prioritize on
        cheapest sites first, the input would be
        ``{"supply_curve_cost_per_mw": "ascending"}``.
    years : list[int]
        Years to disaggregate. Typically from get_reeds_years().
    constrain_to_bins : bool, optional
        If True (default), disaggregation of new and pre-exising capacity will be
        constrained by region, class, and bin. If False, disaggregation will only be
        constrained by region and class. The latter option will result in greater
        flexibility of the disaggregation, but less fidelity to the ReEDS results, and
        is intended primarily for sensitivity testing or bounding scenarios.
    new_incr_mw : float, optional
        Optional size of incremental capacity investments to make for new capacity.
        Controls the incremental amount of capacity invested in each site. The default
        value (1e10) has the effect of not making incremental investments. Instead,
        each site is filled up before moving on to the next. Setting this to a lower
        value (e.g., 6), will result in adding up to 6 MW to each site (limited to the
        capacity available at the site) with a region, resource class, and cost bin, in
        a round-robin fashion, and repeating until all new capacity has been invested.
    refurb_incr_mw : float, optional
        Optional. Similar to new_incr_mw, but affects refurbished capacity instead of
        new capacity. Generally, this should not be changed since refurbished capacity
        is associated with pre-existing capacity, which is spatially concentrated

    Performs the actual disaggregation of capacity from ReEDS regions to reV supply
    curve project sites. Loops through years and determines the investment
    in each supply curve point in each year. Investments are determined by filling up
    all supply curve points in the associated region, class, and (optionally)
    bin simultaneously until total capacity is built.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df_sc_in : pandas.DataFrame
        Modified/simplified version of the technology supply curve.
        All supply curve rows are present but only a subset of the columns are present,
        including: ["sc_gid", "sc_point_gid", "latitude", "longitude", "region",
        "class", "bin", "cap_avail"] plus any priority columns specified by the input
        ``priority`` (e.g., "supply_curve_cost_per_mw").
    df_ret : pandas.DataFrame
        Defines the retirements of capacity by year, region, and class.
        Columns include: ["year", "region", "class", "MW"].
    df_refurbishments : pandas.DataFrame
        Defines the refurbishments of capacity by year, region, and class.
        Columns include: ["year", "region", "class", "MW"].
    df_new_and_preexisting_investments : pandas.DataFrame
        Defines the new and pre-existing deployments of capacity by year, region, class,
        and resource bin. Columns include: ["year", "region", "class", "bin", "MW"].
    df_cap_chk : pandas.DataFrame
        Defines the aggregate capacity by year, region and class.
        Columns include: ["year", "region", "class", "MW"]. Used for a soft check of
        the disaggregation results. If ``None``, the soft check will not be performed.
    years : list[int]
        Years to disaggregate. Typically from get_reeds_years().
    constrain_to_bins : bool, optional
        If True (default), disaggregation of new and pre-exising capacity will be
        constrained by region, class, and bin. If False, disaggregation will only be
        constrained by region and class. The latter option will result in greater
        flexibility of the disaggregation, but less fidelity to the ReEDS results, and
        is intended primarily for sensitivity testing or bounding scenarios.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        Results of disaggregation. Each row represents a reV supply curve project site
        for a given year. Columns describe input information about the project site and
        capacity deployed to that project site. Output columns  include input
        attributes (["sc_gid", "sc_point_gid", "latitude", "longitude",  "region",
        "class", "bin", "cap_avail", "supply_curve_cost_per_mw"]) and outputs from

    ----------
    reeds_run_path : pathlib.Path
        Path to the folder containing the ReEDS run of interest. This folder must

        specified (i.e., None), the sc_path will in the supply curve metadata will
        be used. Will have no effect if specified but filter_tech is None.

    ----------

    priority : str
        Priority option to use for disaggregation. The only priority option currently
        supported is "cost".
    reduced_only : bool
        If True, save a simpler/reduced format of outputs. If False, save full outputs.
    tech : str, optional
        Optional technology to run (e.g., `wind-ons`). If None, all applicable
        technologies will be run.  Allowable values are: ["upv", "wind-ofs", "wind-ons",
        "dupv", "csp"].
    bins : int, optional
        Number of bins used in the supply curve bins. This has no effect, but is
        maintained for compatibility with legacy ReEDS to reV options.
    rev_case : str, optional
        Optional name of the rev_case, which is used to look up the actual supply curve
        files. If None, the rev_case in the supply curve metadata will be used.  Will
        have no effect if specified but tech is None.
    sc_path : str, optional
        Optional path to supply curve files where the specified version resides. If not
        specified (i.e., None), the sc_path will in the supply curve metadata will
        be used. Will have no effect if specified but tech is None.
    new_incr_mw : float, optional
        Optional size of incremental capacity investments to make for new capacity.
        Controls the incremental amount of capacity invested in each site. The default
        value (1e10) has the effect of not making incremental investments. Instead,
        each site is filled up before moving on to the next. Setting this to a lower
        value (e.g., 6), will result in adding up to 6 MW to each site (limited to the
        capacity available at the site) with a region, resource class, and cost bin, in
        a round-robin fashion, and repeating until all new capacity has been invested.
