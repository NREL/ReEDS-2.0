  abstract = {Measuring the contribution of variable and supply-limited generation resources to grid reliability is becoming increasingly relevant as such resources expand their role in the electricity grid. Effective Load Carrying Capability (ELCC) has arisen as an approach to address these challenges. ELCC measures a resource's contribution to reliability based on the load that can be satisfied by adding the resource to the grid. ELCC advances resource accreditation by better reflecting the realities of how supply alternatives contribute to system reliability. It is not, however, a panacea. Implementing an ELCC approach requires challenging judgment calls that, because of the financial consequences for supply resources, are sure to generate controversy. The two primary methods for implementing ELCC, marginal and average, cause market inefficiencies. We compare the two methods using an economic model. The results of our model suggest that, although both methods result in inefficiencies under assumptions consistent with existing market conditions, the inefficiencies under a marginal approach are smaller than the inefficiencies under an average approach. Fortunately, there appear to be ways of addressing the adverse consequences of each method.}

  abstract = {As the world is pledged towards net zero carbon by 2050, the need for clean and efficient energy transitions is more critical than ever. Optimizing the power grid transfer capacity is crucial for maintaining grid stability and reliability. Ageing infrastructure, population growth, and revolutionary technological developments increase the demand for grid modernization and resilience investments. Climate change and natural disasters highlight the need for adaptive load-shedding schemes. The two possible ways to optimize the grid are an ampacity increase or a voltage increase. While increasing voltage provides the most significant rise in rating, it comes with high investment costs. Out of all the options available, dynamic line rating (DLR) is the most efficient and cost-effective solution. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the optimization of the grid transfer capacity using DLR. The review critically examines different line rating methods, the DLR system, factors that need to be considered before DLR implementation, and its advantages and disadvantages. Also, the review presents the real-world applications and case studies, standards and regulations involved, and current approaches and challenges for implementing DLR in Malaysia. Additionally, we highlight the most commonly used standards to calculate the conductor's ampacity for the steady-state and dynamic state. Moreover, this review work presents how DLR can advance the grid's flexibility, considering its significance for cleaner energy production in the future, challenges related to wind energy power generation, and their mitigations. This work provides a shortcut path for researchers and utilities to understand DLR and as a reference for future research to advance clean energy in response to changing energy needs and climate conditions.},

  abstract = {Decarbonization will require deployment of low-carbon technologies, but analysts have struggled to quantify which ones could be deployed in practice---especially where technologies have faced public opposition. For nuclear power, some analysts have tried to solve this problem with caps on deployment or nuclear-free scenarios; however, social science research has not offered nuanced guidance about these caps. We deploy an experiment involving a large U.S. sample (N\,=\,1226) to disentangle public opposition due to the dread of nuclear power from opposition stemming from its actuarial risk. Respondents are asked to build a power generation portfolio that cuts CO2 emissions, given information about the actuarial risks of technologies. Half the sample is exposed to the nuclear power label while the other half is treated with the risk information but blinded to the label. Respondents who see the labels deploy 6.6 percentage points less nuclear power as a share of the U.S. electricity mix. Our results suggest that dread about nuclear power leads respondents to choose 40\% less nuclear generation in 2050 than they would have chosen in the absence of this dread. These methods could apply to other technologies, such as carbon storage, where there may be gaps between actuarial and perceived risks.},

This paper describes the current status and future plans for expansion of nuclear power, the advances in nuclear reactor technology, and their impacts on the associated risks and performance of nuclear power. Advanced nuclear reactors have been designed to be simpler and safer, and to have lower costs than currently operating reactors. By addressing many of the public health and safety risks that plagued the industry since the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, these reactors may help break the current deadlock over nuclear power. In that case, nuclear power could make a significant contribution towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, significant issues persist, fueling reservations among the public and many decision makers. Nuclear safety, disposal of radioactive wastes, and proliferation of nuclear explosives need to be addressed in an effective and credible way if the necessary public support is to be obtained.},

  abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement, as the two biggest climate action initiatives, address the need to shift towards a fully sustainable energy system. The deployment of renewable energy, especially solar and wind power, decreases carbon dioxide emissions, but presents issues of resource intermittency. In this study, a cost-optimised 100\% renewable energy based system is analysed and quantified for the Americas for the reference year 2030 using high spatially and temporally resolved weather data. Several scenarios have been applied, from a decentralised power system towards a fully centralised and interconnected system, taking into account a mix of renewable energy, energy storage and transmission networks. This research aims to evaluate the benefits of an interconnected energy system for the Americas. The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) is between 48.8 and 59.0\,{\texteuro}/MWh depending on the chosen scenario. The results show that the LCOE and total annualised cost drop by 14\% and 15\%, respectively, in a centralised power system. The optimised utilisation of transmission grids leads to less energy storage requirement. Sector coupling brings further benefits by reducing additional 4\% of LCOE, where electricity demand for power, seawater desalination and non-energetic industrial gas sectors have been supplied. A comparison between the interconnected Americas and North and South America individually shows a reduction of 1.6\% and 4.0\% for the total annual system cost and LCOE. Although the cost of the energy system decreased due to wide grid interconnection, substantial benefits have not been achieved as reported earlier for a Pan-American energy system. A scenario with synthetic natural gas (SNG) trading through a liquefied natural gas value chain has also been presented. The results suggest that local SNG production cost in the assumed consumption centre is almost the same as the cost of imported SNG.}

  abstract = {In this study power generation and demand are matched through a least-cost mix of renewable energy (RE) resources and storage technologies for North America by 2030. The study is performed using an hourly resolved model based on a linear optimization algorithm. The geographical, technical and economic potentials of different forms of RE resources enable the option of building a super grid between different North American regions. North America (including the U.S., Canada and Mexico in this paper), is divided into 20 sub-regions based on their population, demand, area and electricity grid structure. Four scenarios have been evaluated: region-wide, country-wide, area-wide and an integrated scenario. The levelised cost of electricity is found to be quite attractive in such a system, with the range from 63 {\texteuro}/MWhel in a decentralized case and 42 {\texteuro}/MWhel in a more centralized and integrated scenario. Electrical grid interconnections significantly reduce the storage requirement and overall cost of the energy system. Among all RE resources, wind and solar PV are found to be the least-cost options and hence the main contributors to fossil fuel substitution. The results clearly show that a 100\% RE-based system is feasible and a real policy option at a modest cost. However, such a tremendous transition will not be possible in a short time if policy-makers, energy investors and other relevant organizations do not support the proposed system.},

  abstract = {PurposeLithium-ion (Li-ion) battery packs recovered from end-of-life electric vehicles (EV) present potential technological, economic and environmental opportunities for improving energy systems and material efficiency. Battery packs can be reused in stationary applications as part of a ``smart grid'', for example to provide energy storage systems (ESS) for load leveling, residential or commercial power. Previous work on EV battery reuse has demonstrated technical viability and shown energy efficiency benefits in energy storage systems modeled under commercial scenarios. The current analysis performs a life cycle assessment (LCA) study on a Li-ion battery pack used in an EV and then reused in a stationary ESS.MethodsA complex functional unit is used to combine energy delivered by the battery pack from the mobility function and the stationary ESS. Various scenarios of cascaded ``EV mobility plus reuse in stationary clean electric power scenarios'' are contrasted with ``conventional system mobility with internal combustion engine vehicles plus natural gas peaking power.'' Eight years are assumed for first use; with 10 years for reuse in the stationary application. Operational scenarios and environmental data are based on real time-of-day and time-of-year power use. Additional data from LCA databases are utilized. Ontario, Canada, is used as the geographic baseline; analysis includes sensitivity to the electricity mix and battery degradation. Seven environmental categories are assessed using ReCiPe.Results and discussionResults indicate that the manufacturing phase of the Li-ion battery will still dominate environmental impacts across the extended life cycle of the pack (first use in vehicle plus reuse in stationary application). For most impact categories, the cascaded use system appears significantly beneficial compared to the conventional system. By consuming clean energy sources for both use and reuse, global and local environmental stress reductions can be supported. Greenhouse gas advantages of vehicle electrification can be doubled by extending the life of the EV batteries, and enabling better use of off-peak low-cost clean electricity or intermittent renewable capacity. However, questions remain concerning implications of long-duration use of raw material resources employed before potential recycling.ConclusionsLi-ion battery packs present opportunities for powering both mobility and stationary applications in the necessary transition to cleaner energy. Battery state-of-health is a considerable determinant in the life cycle performance of a Li-ion battery pack. The use of a complex functional unit was demonstrated in studying a component system with multiple uses in a cascaded application.},

This eighth edition sees improvements in flexibility for instructors and strengthened learning solutions for students. Author C. Donald Ahrens has been widely praised for his ability to explain relatively complicated ideas so that even under-prepared students can understand them. The text's clear and inviting narrative is supplemented by numerous pedagogical features that help augment students' understanding. Introductory stories found at the beginning of each chapter draw students naturally into the discussion. In-chapter reviews help students master concepts while they study, and four types of end-of-chapter exercises provide opportunities for everything from further review to in-class discussion questions. In addition to these in-text learning aids, the eighth edition sees a complete integration with MeteorologyNow?, the first assessment-driven and student-centered online learning solution created specifically for this course. MeteorologyNow? uses a series of chapter-specific diagnostic tests to build a personalized learning plan for each student, allowing students to focus their study time on specific areas of weaknesses. Each personalized learning plan directs students to specific chapter sections and concept-driven multimedia tutorials designed to augment their understanding. The new edition is available in its original nineteen chapter "classic" version, or as a "core" version, which features only the most popular sixteen chapters. The "core" version sacrifices none of the detail that the course needs, but eliminates chapters that may not be directly covered in class. Looking for more flexibility? With the Thomson TextChoice custom solution program, instructors can select and reorganize chapters to perfectly match their syllabus, thereby creating the ideal text solution for the course.},

The situation of Nigeria's electricity power sector is one that has defied virtually every effort made to resurrect it from its state of dilapidation. A major concern is ``can there ever be stable and cost effective electricity in Nigeria?'' The authors are positive this can be realised, but not without considering other forms of electricity energy resources available in Nigeria other than the conventional sources of electricity which is currently the mainstay. A deliberate transition from conventional sources of electricity energy to renewable and environmental friendly sources is critical for national development, even though recent development show the Nigerian government is backsliding in adopting renewable energy technologies. This paper will be used to highlight the different sources of renewable energy which is critical to solve the lingering problem of electricity generation in Nigeria. Hence, based on the literature, modeled scenarios and field experience, the authors discovered it is much easier for individuals to drive this transition to 100\% renewable energy than to continue to depend on government forever.}

  abstract = {A high penetration of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) resources into low-voltage (LV) distribution networks creates reverse power-flow and voltage-rise problems. This generally occurs when the generation from PV resources substantially exceeds the load demand during high insolation period. This paper has investigated the solar PV impacts and developed a mitigation strategy by an effective use of distributed energy storage systems integrated with solar PV units in LV networks. The storage is used to consume surplus solar PV power locally during PV peak, and the stored energy is utilized in the evening for the peak-load support. A charging/discharging control strategy is developed taking into account the current state of charge (SoC) of the storage and the intended length of charging/discharging period to effectively utilize the available capacity of the storage. The proposed strategy can also mitigate the impact of sudden changes in PV output, due to unstable weather conditions, by putting the storage into a short-term discharge mode. The charging rate is adjusted dynamically to recover the charge drained during the short-term discharge to ensure that the level of SoC is as close to the desired SoC as possible. A comprehensive battery model is used to capture the realistic behavior of the distributed energy storage units in a distribution feeder. The proposed PV impact mitigation strategy is tested on a practical distribution network in Australia and validated through simulations.}

  abstract = {HVDC systems are playing an increasingly significant role in energy transmission due to their technical and economic superiority over HVAC systems for long distance transmission. HVDC is preferable beyond 300--800 km for overhead point-to-point transmission projects and for the cable based interconnection or the grid integration of remote offshore wind farms beyond 50--100 km. Several HVDC review papers exist in literature but often focus on specific geographic locations or system components. In contrast, this paper presents a detailed, up-to-date, analysis and assessment of HVDC transmission systems on a global scale, targeting expert and general audience alike. The paper covers the following aspects: technical and economic comparison of HVAC and HVDC systems; investigation of international HVDC market size, conditions, geographic sparsity of the technology adoption, as well as the main suppliers landscape; and high-level comparisons and analysis of HVDC system components such as Voltage Source Converters (VSCs) and Line Commutated Converters (LCCs), etc. The presented analysis are supported by practical case studies from existing projects in an effort to reveal the complex technical and economic considerations, factors and rationale involved in the evaluation and selection of transmission system technology for a given project. The contemporary operational challenges such as the ownership of Multi-Terminal DC (MTDC) networks are also discussed. Subsequently, the required development factors, both technically and regulatory, for proper MTDC networks operation are highlighted, including a future outlook of different HVDC system components. Collectively, the role of HVDC transmission in achieving national renewable energy targets in light of the Paris agreement commitments is highlighted with relevant examples of potential HVDC corridors.},

At the same time, more and more of the energy system is becoming electrified; transportation, heating and fuel usage in industry and elsewhere. This article investigates the development of the Danish energy system in a medium year 2030 situation as well as in a long-term year 2050 situation. The analyses are based on scenario development by the Danish Climate Commission. In the short term, it is investigated what the effects will be of having flexible or inflexible electric vehicles and individual heat pumps, and in the long term it is investigated what the effects of changes in the load profiles due to changing weights of demand sectors are. The analyses are based on energy systems simulations using EnergyPLAN and demand forecasting using the Helena model. The results show that even with a limited short term electric car fleet, these will have a significant effect on the energy system; the energy system's ability to integrate wind power and the demand for condensing power generation capacity in the system. Charging patterns and flexibility have significant effects on this. Likewise, individual heat pumps may affect the system operation if they are equipped with heat storages. The analyses also show that the long term changes in electricity demand curve profiles have little impact on the energy system performance. The flexibility given by heat pumps and electric vehicles in the long term future overshadows any effects of changes in hourly demand curve profiles.}

This article describes a scenario for supplying Aalborg Municipality's energy needs through a combination of low-temperature geothermal heat, wind power and biomass. Of particular focus in the scenario is how low-temperature geothermal heat may be utilised in district heating (DH) systems. The analyses show that it is possible to cover Aalborg Municipality's energy needs through the use of locally available sources in combination with significant electricity savings, heat savings, reductions in industrial fuel use and savings and fuel-substitutions in the transport sector. With biomass resources being finite, the two marginal energy resources in Aalborg are geothermal heat and wind power. If geothermal heat is utilised more, wind power may be limited and vice versa. The system still relies on neighbouring areas as an electricity buffer though. The costs of the scenario are at a comparable level with the reference situation, but with significantly higher needs for investments and lower fuel costs. Implementation of the scenario would therefore have a positive socio-economic impact as investments are more local labour-intensive than fuel supply.}

  abstract = {Summary The United States electricity grid is undergoing rapid changes in response to the sustained low price of natural gas, the falling cost of electricity from variable renewable resources (which are increasingly being paired with Li-ion storage with durations up to {$\sim$}4~h at rated power), and state and local decarbonization policies. Although the majority of recent electricity storage system installations have a duration at rated power of up to {$\sim$}4 h, several trends and potential applications are identified that require electricity storage with longer durations of 10 to {$\sim$}100 h. Such a duration range lies between daily needs that can be satisfied with technologies with the cost structure of lithium-ion batteries and seasonal storage utilizing chemical storage in underground reservoirs. The economics of long-duration storage applications are considered, including contributions for both energy time shift and capacity payments and are shown to differ from the cost structure of applications well served by lithium-ion batteries. In particular, the capital cost for the energy subsystem must be substantially reduced to {$\sim$}3 \$/kWh (for a duration of {$\sim$}100 h), {$\sim$}7 \$/kWh (for a duration of {$\sim$}50 h), or {$\sim$}40 \$/kWh (for a duration of {$\sim$}10 h) on a fully installed basis. Recent developments in major technology classes that may approach the targets of the long-duration electricity storage (LDES) cost framework, including electrochemical, thermal, and mechanical, are briefly reviewed. This perspective, which illustrates the importance of low-cost and high-energy-density storage media, motivates new concepts and approaches for how LDES systems could be economical and provide value to the electricity grid.}

  abstract = {Operation and planning of a power system are constrained by the rating of power lines. Usually, the static line rating is used for system operation and planning. The static line rating defined for an electric grid uses the same conservative weather assumptions for the whole grid regardless of the location of each line or its maximum-allowable conductor temperature. A separate analysis of the weather magnitudes measured in a pilot line shows how favorable air temperature and solar heating compensate for unfavorable wind speed. However, this compensation is limited for higher maximum-allowable conductor temperatures. As a result, the risk of the static line rating exceeding this maximum temperature is higher for HTLS conductors. An adaptive static line rating is proposed to control the assumed risk. The wind speed assumption for the static rating is reduced for higher maximum-allowable conductor temperature.},

We examine a variety of metrics that could be used to compare countries' climate change mitigation efforts and illustrate their potential application to large developed and developing countries. Because there is no single, comprehensive, measurable metric that could be applied to all countries, we suggest using a set of indicators to characterize and compare mitigation effort, akin to using a set of economic statistics to indicate the health of the macroeconomy. Given the iterative pledge-and-review approach that is emerging in the current climate change negotiations, participation, commitment, and compliance could be enhanced if this set of indicators is able to show that all parties are doing their ``fair share,'' both prospectively and retrospectively. The latter, in particular, highlights the need for a well-functioning policy surveillance regime. (JEL: Q54, Q58, F55)}

The resultant hourly imbalances have been used to calculate the interconnection and energy storage requirements. This paper discusses the findings of the BAU scenario. The calculated interconnector capacity required was found to be 60 GW and cost {\pounds}58 billion. Energy storage capacity requirements vary depending on the selected technology. Rated capacity was estimated to be 14 GW with storage capacity of 3 TWh for pumped storage, 11 GW and 2.3 TWh for liquid air, and 65 GW and 13.6 TWh for hydrogen storage, at a cost of {\pounds}65, {\pounds}76 and {\pounds}45 billion respectively. This paper indicates that storing hydrogen in underground caverns would offer the cheapest solution. However, whilst these technological solutions can address generation and demand imbalance in a fully renewable electricity grid, there clearly remain barriers to each technology.}

To explore this issue, hourly demand and electricity generation profiles for a year have been constructed for a variety of renewable sources and demand scenarios. Alongside baseline projections, further scenarios have been produced that include extensive uptake of electric heat pumps for domestic heating and hot water, as well as moderate uptake of electric vehicles. It is proposed that these technologies are used on a local scale to help integrate the additional renewable electricity generated within a predetermined zone of the electricity network. Analysis has been carried out to determine the pinch points in the UK network where renewable electricity generation is greater than local electricity demand. From this, consideration has been given to understanding the real impact distributed energy storage in the form of heat pumps and electric vehicles can have in helping balance a 100\% renewable UK electricity grid. Initial results have found that, depending on the demand scenario and location on the network, there is the potential to accommodate up to 50\% of the excess electricity generated.}

  abstract = {There is unequivocal evidence that the Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate, and that the burning of fossil fuels is the principal cause. This situation is fostering a growing interest in shifting global energy production toward renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower. Hydropower plays an important role in meeting global carbon mitigation targets and eventually achieving net-zero carbon emissions, especially within the Mid-Columbia (Mid-C) energy market in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), where hydropower currently comprises 50-65\% of its generation. However, other renewable energy sources in the Mid-C market and connected California Independent System Operator (CAISO) power grid are expanding significantly, particularly solar power in California (CA). Thus, hydropower operations at plants within the connected Mid-C market may need to be re-operated to balance the more intermittent supply from renewables in CA so that energy supplies are in phase with demands. In this study, our goal is to re-design hydropower operations in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) of the PNW to achieve a 95\% renewable energy power grid in CA and the PNW by the year 2035. This will require not only filling supply gaps from other renewable energy sources, but also balancing other conflicting objectives to be fulfilled by the dam operations, such as minimizing environmental spill violations, maximizing hydropower production, maximizing flood protection, and maximizing economic benefits. We use multi-objective optimization to design alternative operations at four CRB dams to balance these objectives over the historical record. We then simulate their operations over alternative possible future climate change and energy development scenarios to find a recommended set of operations that are robust to these uncertainties. The energy scenarios include the National Renewable Energy Lab's (NREL) Mid-Case Energy Scenario for the years 2025, 2030 and 2035, which achieve 95\% Renewables by 2035, as well as a business as usual (BAU), or base case, scenario represented by the historical energy mix. The four climate scenarios are made from combinations of low or high warming and low or high streamflow for three overlapping time steps: 2020-2029, 2025-2034, and 2030-2039. Our optimization is able to find a robust compromise policy that balances the system's conflicting objectives well both now and in the future. We close by exploring how this policy coordinates operations across system reservoirs, which could inform reservoir operators in the CRB about how to adapt operations as the system changes in the future.}

In December 2013, the Mexican Congress approved a series of constitutional amendments that intended to open the hydrocarbons and power sectors to private and foreign investment for the first time since the 1950s through profit- and production-sharing contracts and through new licenses for exploration and production. This energy reform was boosted by the decline in oil and gas exploration and production over the past 10 years, and the rise of electricity prices for both industrial and domestic consumers. Even though it is still soon to analyse the impact that the energy reform is having on Mexico׳s energy sector, this reform is likely to have a profound impact on long-term oil and gas production in Mexico, as well as on its power sector. In this sense, in relation with the changes that the Mexican energy reform entails both in the hydrocarbons and power sector, two competing visions of advocates and opponents have arisen since its approval.}

  abstract = {The traditional methodology for defining the ampacity of overhead lines is based on conservative criteria regarding the operating conditions of the line, leading to the so-called static line rating. Although this procedure has been considered satisfactory for decades, it is nowadays sensible to account for more realistic line operating conditions when calculating its dynamic ampacity. Dynamic line rating is a technology used to improve the ampacity of overhead transmission lines based on the assumption that ampacity is not a static value but a function of weather and line's operating conditions. In order to apply this technology, it is necessary to monitor and predict the temperature of the conductor over time by direct or indirect measurements. This paper presents an algorithm to estimate and predict the temperature in overhead line conductors using an Extended Kalman Filter, with the aim of minimizing the mean square error in the current and subsequent states (temperature) of the conductor. The proposed algorithm assumes both actual weather and current intensity flowing along the conductor as control variables. The temperature of the conductor, mechanical tension and sag of the catenary are used as measurements because the common practice is to measure these values with dynamic line rating hardware. The algorithm has been validated by both simulations and measurements. The results of this study conclude that it is possible to implement the algorithm into Dynamic Line Rating systems, leading to a more accurate estimation and prediction of temperature.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the impact of large-scale PV generation, up to 50\% penetration level, on distribution system voltage regulation and voltage stability. The system voltage profiles are computed using power-flow calculations with load variation of a 24-hour time scale. The voltage stability is examined at different times of the day using a developed continuation power-flow method with demand as continuation parameter and up to the maximum loading conditions. The load-flow analysis implemented for both voltage regulation and voltage stability analysis is performed by using the forward/backward sweep method. The secant predictor technique is developed for predicting the node voltages which are then corrected using the load flow solver. Three models of the PV interface inverter are implemented in this study with full set of data representing environmental conditions. The voltage profiles are regulated using the PV interface inverters which support reactive power at unavailability of sun light. The available inverter capacity is utilized for regulating the system node voltages. The most possible scenarios of system voltage collapse are investigated at different times of the day. The developed methods and models are used to assess the performance of a 33-bus radial distribution feeder with high level of PV penetration. The results show that the PV interface inverters have to be designed to operate for reactive power support in order to improve voltage profile, secure power systems operation, and increase the lifetime of the online tap changing transformers.}

The study also presents some commonly understood effects of shading on photovoltaic panels, both in the form of uniform shading (weak light) and partial shading. Other snow-related aspects of operating a photovoltaic system are also brought up, such as snow loads and the risks posed by snowmelt, particularly in regards to building-integrated or building-applied photovoltaics. Common methods of addressing snow-related challenges are summarized, both on a material and on an architectural level. Lastly, suggested future research paths are presented.}

  abstract = {California has set ambitious decarbonization goals concerning both emissions and the portion of energy generated by renewable resources. However, climate change poses considerable uncertainties. Variation in load is driven both by the level of electrification as well as the impact of climate change on weather. Further, climate change stands to make weather more variable, impacting not just load but generation from renewable resources. In this paper, we approach the issue of the impacts of climate change on decarbonization planning from two perspectives. First, we look at the range of decarbonization pathways through 8 pathways that account for differences in socioeconomic development, global emissions, and warming. Second, we develop a more robust way of ensuring the reliability of energy resources planning than the commonly used planning reserve margin. We show that the proposed method can save between 6 and 14 billion dollars in investment and maintenance costs and outline critical policy implications concerning the reliance of power plants for satisfying planning reliability requirements, including the potential retirement of dozens of peaker power plants.},

Optimizing capacity expansion generally involves selecting surrogate representative days from forecasts of load and the generation profiles of variable RE resources. To properly select those representative days, we propose a novel input-based approach in combination with the kmeans clustering algorithm that utilize three unique operational characteristics: load shedding, renewable curtailment, and transmission congestion. The proposed method allows for more robust and cost-effective capacity planning. The method is validated using a capacity expansion model and a production cost model aligned with California Independent System Operator (CAISO)'s decarbonization goals, and results in significant cost reduction and substantial decreases in load shedding.},

Here, our weather-driven methodology is described and applied to model the Danish power system with combined wind and solar energy gross shares of up to 100\% of the total demand. We show that in a wind only scenario, surplus energy grows rapidly beyond gross shares of about 50\%, while the potential for arbitrage of surplus renewable energy, i.e. demand-side management or high-efficiency storage, is very limited in this case. A scenario with a wind-solar energy mix of 80/20, on the other hand, both decreases~the total amount of surplus and has a significantly higher potential for arbitrage of the remaining surplus. However, beyond gross shares of about 75\%, only large-scale seasonal storage of, e.g. hydrogen, enables the use of Danish surplus wind and solar energy to cover the residual Danish electricity demand in both scenarios.}

Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to develop a novel model that can help bidding of W-PV farms considering a range of objectives that maximize the environmental and welfare benefits. This new approach contributes to energy planning for any type of hybrid farm through multi-objective programming, even in cases where the optimization of several correlated outputs is desired. Using the proposed approach the optimal system configuration can be obtained in these cases with low computational costs. A non-linear multi-objective optimization (NL-MO) is proposed to optimize the area occupied by the W-PV farm, minimum feasibility price, electricity production expected, and standard-deviation of the electricity produced. The model has been elaborated from non-linear optimization using the normal-boundary intersection (NBI) method, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and Taguchi signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The optimal values for the response variables are an area of 132.92 km2, minimum price of 182.95 R\$/MWh, annual electricity production of 72.17 GWh, with a standard deviation of 1.74 GWh and the ideal share is 41\% wind power and 59\% PV power.}

However, as specific criteria for contracting this type of project have not yet been developed, this paper presents a model to assist the government in contracting projects that maximize the socioeconomic well-being of the Brazilian electricity sector. For this, multiobjective programming is used to simultaneously handle two objective functions---maximally reducing emission density and minimizing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE)---with the aid of the mixture arrangement technique. In this respect, the optimization method called normal boundary intersection (NBI) is applied to solve the multiobjective problem and construct the Pareto frontier. Additionally, a metric based on the ratio between entropy and the global percentage error (GPE) is used to identify the optimal Pareto solution. The model was applied to determine optimal configurations for wind-PV powerplants in twelve Brazilian cities, and the results obtained reveal the capacity of the model to indicate the optimum configuration according to the wind and PV potential of each city.}

This paper explores some of the implications of achieving such high levels of renewable electricity for supply chains and the environment in scenarios with renewable supply up to such levels. Expanding the renewable electricity supply at this scale by 2050 implies annual capacity additions of roughly 20 gigawatts per year (GW/year) over the next decade, rising to roughly 40 GW/year from 2040 to 2050. Given total 2012 renewable electricity capacity additions of slightly more than 16 GW, this suggests moderate growth of the related supply chains, averaging overall roughly 4\% annual growth to 2040. Transitioning to high renewable electricity supply would lead to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and water use, with only modest land-use implications. While renewable energy expansion implies moderate growth of the renewable electricity supply chains, no insurmountable long-term constraints to renewable electricity technology manufacturing capacity or materials supply are identified.}

If unconventional natural gas in the U.S. is produced responsibly, transported and distributed with little leakage, and incorporated into integrated energy systems that are designed for future resiliency, it could play a significant role in realizing a more sustainable energy future; however, the increased use of natural gas as a substitute for more carbon intensive fuels will alone not substantially alter world carbon dioxide concentration projections. This paper reviews recent developments in the production and use of unconventional natural gas in the United States with a focus on environmental impacts. Specifically, we focus on water management and greenhouse gas emission implications. If unconventional natural gas in the United States is produced responsibly, transported and distributed with little leakage, and incorporated into integrated energy systems that are designed for future resiliency, it could play a significant role in realizing a more sustainable energy future. The cutting-edge of industry water management practices gives a picture of how this transition is unfolding, although much opportunity remains to minimize water use and related environmental impacts. The role of natural gas to mitigate climate forcing is less clear. While natural gas has low CO2 emissions upon direct use, methane leakage and long term climate effects lead to the conclusion that increased use of natural gas as a substitute for more carbon intensive fuels will not substantially alter world carbon dioxide concentration projections, and that other zero or low carbon energy sources will be needed to limit GHG concentrations. We conclude with some possible avenues for further work.}

  abstract = {This research uses an optimization model to compare the role of rooftop solar generation versus large-scale solar and wind farm installations in renewable energy planning. The model consists of competing objectives, minimizing annual generation costs and minimizing annual greenhouse gas emissions. Rather than focus on the individual consumer's investment decision, over 20 scenarios were developed which explored key input parameters such as the maximum penetration level of rooftop solar installations, pricing of equipment, tax credits, and net-metering policy to determine what role rooftop solar plays in renewable energy investment at an aggregate level. The research finds that at lower levels of penetration, such as those currently found in the United States, other renewable energy sources remain viable options, thus rooftop solar should be just one option considered when increasing development of renewable energy sources. The research also shows that a balanced approach taking into account both of the opposing objectives will lead to greater levels of rooftop solar generation than focusing solely on cost or emissions. Therefore, rooftop solar should be considered as part of an overall balanced approach to increasing renewable energy generation.}

By augmenting k-means with a very simple, randomized seeding technique, we obtain an algorithm that is {$\Theta$}(log k)-competitive with the optimal clustering. Preliminary experiments show that our augmentation improves both the speed and the accuracy of k-means, often quite dramatically.},

  abstract = {s National-scale energy systems optimisation models (ESOMs) have been limited in the past by the lack of sub-national data availability leading to aggregated treatment of spatial dynamics. This review paper first determines how a combination of supply and demand data requirements and socio-economic, environmental and political issues, can challenge the results of a low-spatial resolution model. It also demonstrates the incompleteness of single region ESOMs that do not capture sufficient spatial detail. Specifically, 36 multi-regional ESOMs from 22 countries with varying levels of spatiotemporal resolution, sectoral focus and planning horizon are systematically identified and comprehensively analysed. The review reveals that existing temporally explicit ESOMs with a single sector coverage can permit regional disaggregation up to the first-level administrative divisions within a country (such as state and province) while maintaining computationally tractable. Findings from the literature review also show when, how, and to what extent higher spatial resolution impact on the results of energy system analysis. (1) Finer spatial resolution in ESOMs offers significant added value for regions with heterogeneous renewable potential or across regions with higher variability in energy service demands. However, in homogeneous areas, aggregated single-region modelling is more efficient. (2) Spatially resolved models can significantly change the results of the scenarios with very high shares of variable renewable energies. But it is not straightforward to find a direct relationship between the level of geographic disaggregation and penetration of renewable energies. This trade-off should be explored case-by-case. (3) Total system costs can be under- or over-estimated in various levels of spatial resolutions. Disaggregation of renewable resources leads to lower costs, and disaggregation of transmission grids leads to higher costs.},

  abstract = {To better assess the contribution of wind power plants (WPPs) during disturbances, Hydro-Qu{\'e}bec Trans{\'E}nergie (HQT), the main transmission system operator in the Quebec Interconnection, uses on-line monitoring to record data at the point of common coupling of each WPP. This data is used to analyse their performance during voltage and frequency disturbances. Until recently, very few WPPs were able to provide an inertial response (IR) for under-frequency events. On 28 December 2015, a generation loss of 1700 MW caused a frequency nadir of 59.08 Hz on the system, to which most WPPs required to provide IR contributed significantly. The analysis of the event showed that the behaviour of the WPPs had a significant effect on the recovery of the system frequency. This study presents the performance analysis of WPPs during this under-frequency event. The analysis is based on data collected from 25 large-scale WPPs in operation and equipped with the IR feature as required by HQT. Field measurements and simulation results are used to emphasise the effect of the active power reduction during the recovery phase. Impacts of the IR from the WPPs as used on the Hydro-Quebec system are discussed.}

  abstract = {This paper covers three policy-relevant aspects of the carbon content of electricity that are well established among integrated assessment models but under-discussed in the policy debate. First, climate stabilization at any level from 2 to 3{$^\circ$}C requires electricity to be almost carbon-free by the end of the century. As such, the question for policy makers is not whether to decarbonize electricity but when to do it. Second, decarbonization of electricity is still possible and required if some of the key zero-carbon technologies -- such as nuclear power or carbon capture and storage -- turn out to be unavailable. Third, progressive decarbonization of electricity is part of every country's cost-effective means of contributing to climate stabilization. In addition, this paper provides cost-effective pathways of the carbon content of electricity -- computed from the results of AMPERE, a recent integrated assessment model comparison study. These pathways may be used to benchmark existing decarbonization targets, such as those set by the European Energy Roadmap or the Clean Power Plan in the United States, or inform new policies in other countries. The pathways can also be used to assess the desirable uptake rates of electrification technologies, such as electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, electric stoves and heat pumps, or industrial electric furnaces.}

Flexible temperature response functions are estimated by climate zone, which allow for differential effects of days in different temperature bins on households' electricity consumption. The estimation uses a comprehensive household level dataset of electricity bills for California's three investor-owned utilities (Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison). The results suggest that the temperature response varies greatly across climate zones. Simulation results using a downscaled version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research global circulation model suggest that holding population constant, total consumption for the households considered may increase by up to 55\% by the end of the century. The study further simulates the impacts of higher electricity prices and different scenarios of population growth. Finally, simulations were conducted consistent with higher adoption of cooling equipment in areas which are not yet saturated, as well as gains in efficiency due to aggressive energy efficiency policies.},

The energy security is evaluated in terms of energy system resistance to disturbances. The methodology comprises several models, such as a stochastic model of energy systems disturbance parameters, economic-optimization model of energy systems functioning, metric and analysis techniques of energy security. The perspective development and functioning of the energy systems with stochastic disturbances is modelled using economic-optimization model with the development of different energy generation technologies. An open source energy modelling system is used as a tool for this model. The concept of energy security coefficient, which is calculated to assess energy security in terms of energy price increase and the amounts of unsupplied energy due to the disturbance consequences, is presented in the article as well. The developed methodology is applied to the case study of the reference energy system. Its various development scenarios with different energy generation technologies are analysed according to the share of technologies in the energy production. Scenarios are simulated in the stochastic environment of various disturbances and results are obtained in terms of variation of energy security coefficient over time by comparing scenarios from the energy security point of view. Finally, the results of the development scenarios are discussed, threshold shares in the energy production and optimal mix of energy generation technologies in terms of energy security are proposed, limitations of the case study are identified and some general conclusions are given.}

However, the access to solar power at near zero marginal costs may well induce rebound effects which shift households' demand curve and distort the net effects of solar PV investments. By analyzing high frequency data on household electricity consumption and production, we document solar PV rebound effect of 7.7 percent, a result that is robust to different sample and model specifications. We also find that households shift their consumption to the time periods when solar electricity production is higher. The solar PV rebound effect shows heterogeneity across time and production level, with higher rebound effects during seasons characterized by higher solar irradiance.}

This paper highlights the net demand planning feasibility assessment to understand these dynamics. These dynamics underpins the technical feasibility when setting up high penetration of PVs within a new development area. Real measurements of disaggregated domestic electricity demand from three low-carbon homes and simulated PV output are used. A case study is based on a new building development in North West Bicester Eco Town, Oxfordshire, consisting of 393 homes, community and commercial units. Using simulation models and real domestic load measurements, the results show potential for demand management and energy storage. With a sensitivity analysis, the paper discusses also related energy policy aspects such as options for PV orientation aspects, the use of Electric Vehicles (EVs), the potential of Direct Current electrical installations and schemes that encourage load shifting. The paper concludes, within the context of the case study, assumptions and scenarios that, contrary to what is commonly believed, high penetration of PVs in a development area is feasible and may even reduce grid infrastructure costs.}

This article tackles that problem by comparing two possible ways of developing a 100\% renewable energy system, using Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, as a case. The first one is a traditional non-integrated renewable energy system, where each energy sector is developed independently, while the second is based on the smart energy system concept, where different sectors are linked together in order to exploit synergies and increase the efficiency of the system. Scenarios for Zagreb according to these two approaches are developed and modelled in EnergyPLAN. The results show that a smart energy system can reach up to 49\% of the total electricity production from intermittent sources on a yearly basis, while a traditional non-integrated system utilizes 50\% more biomass than what is assessed to be sustainable. Therefore, a smart energy system is a beneficial option for Zagreb in terms of technical feasibility, while from an economic perspective, the total costs of the two scenarios are essentially at the same level.}

As the present energy supply on Croatian islands relies mostly on fossil fuels and electricity from the mainland, it becomes obvious that exploitation of renewable energy sources is the only solution that leads towards self-sufficiency and sustainable development. In order to design a self-sufficient and sustainable island, three major technological changes are needed: integration of renewable energy sources alongside with energy savings and improvements in energy efficiency in the energy production. Analyses for several other Croatian islands have been performed using Renewislands/ADEG methodology in order to assess all possible outcomes. The scenarios in these cases have shown that islands can become self-sufficient through combining renewable technologies and energy storage systems. Energy storage systems will be crucial for achieving desired objectives in terms of energy independence from the mainland and in general import of fossil fuels. The analysis conducted for the island of Hvar will result in creation of several scenarios which will clearly point out the favorable solutions for improvement of both security of energy supply and covering the majority of energy demand with renewable energy sources and storage technologies. Also, when talking about implementation of renewable technologies on island of Hvar, an optimal mix of technologies must be applied in order to avoid excess costs and to achieve minimal impact on environment in terms of visual pollution.}

  abstract = {The benefits and costs of increasing solar electricity generation depend on the scale of the increase and on the time frame over which it occurs. Short-run analyses focus on the cost-effectiveness of incremental increases in solar capacity, holding the rest of the power system fixed. Solar's variability adds value if its power occurs at high-demand times and displaces relatively carbon-intensive generation. Medium-run analyses consider the implications of nonincremental changes in solar capacity. The cost of each installation may fall through experience effects, but the cost of grid integration increases when solar requires ancillary services and fails to displace investment in other types of generation. Long-run analyses consider the role of solar in reaching twenty-first-century carbon targets. Solar's contribution depends on the representation of grid integration costs, on the availability of other low-carbon technologies, and on the potential for technological advances. By surveying analyses for different time horizons, this article begins to connect and integrate a fairly disjointed literature on the economics of solar energy.}

  abstract = {This paper determines a least cost electricity solution for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The power system discussed in this study is hourly resolved and based on 100\% Renewable Energy (RE) technologies. Sub-Saharan Africa was subdivided into 16 sub-regions. Four different scenarios were considered involving the setup of a high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission grid. An integrated scenario that considers water desalination and industrial gas production was also analyzed. This study reveals that RE is sufficient to cover 866.4\,TWh estimated electricity demand for 2030 and additional electricity needed to fulfill 319 million\,m3 of water desalination and 268\,TWhLHV of synthetic natural gas demand. Existing hydro dams can be used as virtual batteries for solar PV and wind electricity storage, diminishing the role of other storage technologies. The results for total levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) decreases from 57.8 {\texteuro}/MWh for a highly decentralized to 54.7 {\texteuro}/MWh for a more centralized grid scenario. For the integrated scenario, including water desalination and synthetic natural gas demand, the levelised cost of gas and the levelised cost of water are 113.7 {\texteuro}/MWhLHV and 1.39 {\texteuro}/m3, respectively. A reduction of 6\% in total cost and 19\% in electricity generation was realized as a result of integrating desalination and power-to-gas sectors into the system. A review of studies on the energy future of Sub-Saharan Africa provides the basis for a detailed discussion of the new results presented.}

  abstract = {Power systems for South and Central America based on 100\% renewable energy (RE) in the year 2030 were calculated for the first time using an hourly resolved energy model. The region was subdivided into 15 sub-regions. Four different scenarios were considered: three according to different high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission grid development levels (region, country, area-wide) and one integrated scenario that considers water desalination and industrial gas demand supplied by synthetic natural gas via power-to-gas (PtG). RE is not only able to cover 1813 TWh of estimated electricity demand of the area in 2030 but also able to generate the electricity needed to fulfil 3.9 billion m3 of water desalination and 640 TWhLHV of synthetic natural gas demand. Existing hydro dams can be used as virtual batteries for solar and wind electricity storage, diminishing the role of storage technologies. The results for total levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) are decreased from 62 {\texteuro}/MWh for a highly decentralized to 56 {\texteuro}/MWh for a highly centralized grid scenario (currency value of the year 2015). For the integrated scenario, the levelized cost of gas (LCOG) and the levelized cost of water (LCOW) are 95 {\texteuro}/MWhLHV and 0.91 {\texteuro}/m3, respectively. A reduction of 8\% in total cost and 5\% in electricity generation was achieved when integrating desalination and power-to-gas into the system.},

  abstract = {Most state renewables portfolio standard (RPS) policies in the United States have five or more years of implementation experience. Understanding the costs and benefits of these policies is essential for RPS administrators tasked with implementation and for policymakers evaluating changes to existing or development of new RPS policies. This study estimates and summarizes historical RPS costs and benefits, and provides a critical examination of cost and benefit estimation methods used by utilities and regulators. We find that RPS compliance costs constituted less than 2\% of average retail rates in most U.S. states over the 2010--2013 period, although substantial variation exists, both from year-to-year and across states. Compared to RPS costs, relatively few states have undertaken detailed estimates of broader societal benefits of RPS programs, and then only for a subset of potential impacts, typically some combination of avoided emissions and human health benefits, economic development impacts, and wholesale electricity market price reductions. Although direct comparison to RPS cost estimates is not possible, the available studies of broader RPS benefits suggest that in many cases these impacts may at least be of the same order of magnitude as costs, highlighting a need for more refined analysis.}

S. national-level assessment of state RPS program benefits and impacts, focusing on new renewable electricity resources used to meet RPS compliance obligations in 2013. In our central-case scenario, reductions in life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions from displaced fossil fuel-generated electricity resulted in \$2.2 billion of global benefits. Health and environmental benefits from reductions in criteria air pollutants (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter 2.5) were even greater, estimated at \$5.2 billion in the central case. Further benefits accrued in the form of reductions in water withdrawals and consumption for power generation. Finally, although best considered resource transfers rather than net societal benefits, new renewable electricity generation used for RPS compliance in 2013 also supported nearly 200,000 U. S.-based gross jobs and reduced wholesale electricity prices and natural gas prices, saving consumers a combined \$1.3--\$4.9 billion. In total, the estimated benefits and impacts well-exceed previous estimates of RPS compliance costs.}

The update includes assigning the test system a geographic location in the southwestern United States to enable the integration of spatio-temporally consistent wind, solar, and load data with forecasts. Additional updates include common RTS transmission modifications in published literature, definitions for reserve product requirements, and market simulation descriptions to enable benchmarking of multi-period power system scheduling problems. The final section presents example results from a production cost modeling simulation on the updated RTS system data.}

  abstract = {We explore the plausible range of future deployment of photovoltaic generation capacity in the USA using a supply-focused model based on supply-chain growth constraints and a demand-focused model based on minimizing the overall cost of the electricity system. Both approaches require assumptions based on previous experience and anticipated trends. For each of the models, we assign plausible ranges for the key assumptions and then compare the resulting PV deployment over time. Each model was applied to 2 different future scenarios: one in which PV market penetration is ultimately constrained by the uncontrolled variability of solar power and one in which low-cost energy storage or some equivalent measure largely alleviates this constraint. The supply-focused and demand-focused models are in substantial agreement, not just in the long term, where deployment is largely determined by the assumed market penetration constraints, but also in the interim years. For the future scenario without low-cost energy storage or equivalent measures, the 2 models give an average plausible range of PV generation capacity in the USA of 150 to 530 GWdc in 2030 and 260 to 810 GWdc in 2040. With low-cost energy storage or equivalent measures, the corresponding ranges are 160 to 630 GWdc in 2030 and 280 to 1200 GWdc in 2040. The latter range is enough to supply 10\% to 40\% of US electricity demand in 2040, based on current demand growth.},

In this paper, the achievement of these goals is modeled by introducing an innovative method of soft-linking of EnergyPLAN with the generic optimization program (GenOpt). This soft-link enables simulation-based optimization, guided with the chosen optimization algorithm, rather than manual adjustments of the decision vectors. In order to obtain EnergyPLAN simulations within the optimization loop of GenOpt, the decision vectors should be chosen and explained in GenOpt for scenarios created in EnergyPLAN. The result of the optimization loop is an optimal national energy master plan (as a case study, energy policy in Serbia was taken), followed with sensitivity analysis of the exogenous assumptions and with focus on the contribution of the smart electricity grid to the achievement of EU2030 goals. It is shown that the increase in the policy-induced total costs of less than 3\% is not significant. This general method could be further improved and used worldwide in the optimal planning of sustainable national energy systems.}

We argue that by combining these, in fact, complementary measures, it is possible to address the crucial issue of renewable generation---fluctuating supply---in a comprehensive as well as in a technologically and economically viable manner. Thus, the SuperSmart Grid simultaneously can contribute to energy security, climate security, social security, and national security.}

To quantify general features of such a weather dependent electricity supply in the contiguous US, wind and solar PV generation data are calculated, based on 32 years of weather data with temporal resolution of 1 h and spatial resolution of 40 {\texttimes} 40 km 2 , assuming site-suitability-based and stochastic wind and solar capacity distributions. The regional wind-and-solar mixes matching load and generation closest on seasonal timescales cluster around 80\% solar share, owing to the US summer load peak. This mix more than halves long-term storage requirements, compared to wind only. The mixes matching generation and load best on daily timescales lie at about 80\% wind share, due to the nightly gap in solar production. Going from solar only to this mix reduces backup energy needs by about 50\%. Furthermore, we calculate shifts in FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission)-level LCOE (Levelized Costs Of Electricity) for wind and solar PV due to differing weather conditions. Regional LCOE vary by up to 29\%, and LCOE-optimal mixes largely follow resource quality. A transmission network enhancement among FERC regions is constructed to transfer high penetrations of solar and wind across FERC boundaries, employing a novel least-cost optimization.}

We present optimized pathways for the build-up of wind and solar power for least backup energy needs as well as for least cost obtained with a simplified, lightweight model based on long-term high resolution weather-determined generation data. In the absence of storage, the pathway which achieves the best match of generation and load, thus resulting in the least backup energy requirements, generally favors a combination of both technologies, with a wind/solar PV (photovoltaics) energy mix of about 80/20 in a fully renewable scenario. The least cost development is seen to start with 100\% of the technology with the lowest average generation costs first, but with increasing renewable installations, economically unfavorable excess generation pushes it toward the minimal backup pathway. Surplus generation and the entailed costs can be reduced significantly by combining wind and solar power, and/or absorbing excess generation, for example with storage or transmission, or by coupling the electricity system to other energy sectors.}

VRES growth predictions according to the official National Renewable Energy Action Plans of the EU countries are used and extrapolated logistically up to a fully VRES-supplied power system. We find that keeping today's international NTCs (net transfer capacities) fixed over the next forty years reduces the final need for backup energy by 13\% when compared to the situation with no NTCs. An overall doubling of today's NTCs will lead to a 26\% reduction, and an overall quadrupling to a 33\% reduction. The remaining need for backup energy is due to correlations in the generation patterns, and cannot be further reduced by transmission. The main investments in transmission lines are due during the ramp-up of VRES from 15\% (as planned for 2020) to 80\%. Additionally, our results show how the optimal mix between wind and solar energy shifts from about 70\% to 80\% wind share as the transmission grid is enhanced. Finally, we exemplify how reinforced transmission affects the import and export opportunities of single countries during the VRES ramp-up.}

  abstract = {An assessment of decarbonization pathways in energy models reveals fundamental limitations in representing factors that are relevant for practical decision-making. Although these modelling limitations are widely acknowledged, their impact on the deployment of individual power generation types is not well understood. As a result, the societal value from such generation types could be vastly misrepresented. Here we explore a wide spectrum of factors that impact offshore wind deployment in the United States using a detailed capacity expansion model. Many factors prescribe a large future role for offshore wind, yet this diverges from what models often show. We extend the typically narrow modelling context through high spatial resolution, several cost and transmission possibilities and various energy-sector policies. We estimate offshore wind to constitute 1--8\% (31--256\,gigawatts) of total US generation by 2050. This wide range suggests an uncertain but potentially important regional role. Our expansive scenarios demonstrate how to address many limitations of decarbonization modelling.},

  abstract = {The U.S.-Canadian power system has evolved into a highly integrated grid. Cross-border transmission and coordination of system operations create an interconnected power system with combined imports and exports of electricity of greater than 77\,TWh per year. Currently, more than 5 GW of new international transmission lines are in various stages of permitting and development. These transmission lines may enable even greater integration and coordination of the U.S. and Canadian systems, which can in turn increase the reliability and flexibility of North America's electricity grid and help address challenges associated with integrating high levels of variable renewables. Using a version of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) model that incorporates Canada, this analysis quantifies the differences in the evolution of the power system under scenarios in which cross-border transmission capacity is restricted to today's levels, and scenarios in which new transmission is less restricted. These impacts are analyzed under a ``business-as-usual'' reference scenario and a scenario in which deep cuts in power sector carbon dioxide emissions levels are achieved. A set of key impact metrics is analyzed, including 1) the composition of generating capacity by technology, 2) system costs, 3) wholesale electricity prices, 4) international electricity exports and imports, 5) transmission capacity, and 6) carbon dioxide emission levels. When new cross-border transmission is not allowed, the United States needs additional capacity (primarily natural gas and renewable energy) to meet domestic needs, while total Canadian capacity is lower because less capacity is needed to export to the United States. This effect is amplified under the carbon cap scenario. Impacts vary on a regional basis, largely due to the different relative sizes of the generation portfolio between countries and regions and the relative impact from cross-border electricity trade. The total impact from restricting cross-border trade on carbon emissions and average wholesale electricity prices is limited, due to the relative size of the domestic power systems and the cross-border trade volume. Cross-border transmission capacity is projected to more than double under the unrestricted transmission capacity scenarios, which exceeds the rate of projected domestic transmission capacity additions in each country.}

Natural gas prices are highly volatile and have shown a general upward trend. Wind energy can provide a cost-effective hedge against natural gas price volatility or price increases. This conclusion is based on analysis of the costs of marginal conventional generation given the historical probability distribution of natural gas prices, the cost of wind energy, wind integration costs, transmission costs for wind energy, the capacity value of wind, and environmental benefits of wind energy for a hypothetical utility in the Southwestern United States. The efficacy of using wind energy as a hedge at a particular utility will depend on site specific conditions.}

  abstract = {Most of the existing overhead transmission lines (TLs) are assigned a static rating by considering the conservative environmental conditions (e.g., high ambient temperature and low wind speed). Such a conservative approach often results in underutilization of line ampacity because the worst conditions prevail only for a short period of time during the year. Dynamic line rating (DLR) utilizes local meteorological conditions and grid loadings to adaptively compute additional line ampacity headroom that may be available due to favorable local environmental conditions. This paper details Idaho National Laboratory-developed weather-based DLR, which utilizes a state-of-the-art general line ampacity state solver for real-time computation of thermal ratings of TLs. Performance of the proposed DLR solution is demonstrated in existing TL segments at AltaLink, Canada, and the potential benefits of the proposed DLR for enhanced transmission ampacity utilization are quantified. Moreover, we investigated a hypothetical case for emulating the impact of an additional wind plant near the test grid. The results for the given system and data configurations demonstrated that real-time ratings were above the seasonal static ratings for at least 76.6\% of the time, with a mean increase of 22\% over the static rating, thereby demonstrating huge potential for improvement on ampacity utilization.},

Such an approach often results in the underutilization of the overhead TL capacity as the most conservative environmental conditions occur only for a short period over an year/season. We present computational fluid dynamics (CFD) enhanced weather-based dynamic line rating (DLR) as an enabling smart grid technology that adaptively computes ratings of TLs based on local weather conditions to utilize the additional headroom of line ampacity due to concurrent cooling of existing lines. In particular, a general line ampacity state solver is proposed to utilize measured weather data for computing the real-time thermal rating of the TLs. The performance of the proposed CFD enhanced weather-based DLR is demonstrated from a field study of DLR technology implementation on four TL segments at AltaLink, Canada. The performance is evaluated by comparing the existing static and the proposed dynamic line ratings, and the potential benefits of DLR for enhanced transmission assets utilization are quantified. For the given line segments, the proposed DLR results in real-time ratings above the seasonal static ratings for most of the time (up to 95.1\%) with a mean increase of 72\% over static rating.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, human influence on the climate through increased use of fossil fuels has become widely acknowledged as one of the most pressing issues for the global community. For the United Kingdom, we suggest that these concerns have increasingly become manifest in a new strand of political debate around energy policy, which reframes nuclear power as part of the solution to the need for low-carbon energy options. A mixed-methods analysis of citizen views of climate change and radioactive waste is presented, integrating focus group data and a nationally representative survey. The data allow us to explore how UK citizens might now and in the future interpret and make sense of this new framing of nuclear power?which ultimately centers on a risk?risk trade-off scenario. We use the term ?reluctant acceptance? to describe how, in complex ways, many focus group participants discursively re-negotiated their position on nuclear energy when it was positioned alongside climate change. In the concluding section of the paper, we reflect on the societal implications of the emerging discourse of new nuclear build as a means of delivering climate change mitigation and set an agenda for future research regarding the (re)framing of the nuclear energy debate in the UK and beyond.},

This paper investigates the role of temporal (``when'') flexibility from emission banking provisions under an economy-wide cap-and-trade policy in the USA. The current literature on meeting deep decarbonization targets almost exclusively assumes unlimited banking, which may bias policy recommendations and have important consequences for R\&D prioritization and model development. Numerical experiments using the energy-economic model US Regional Energy, GHG, and Economy (US-REGEN) indicate that assumptions about banking materially impact cost and emission pathways in meeting long-term targets like 80\% reductions by 2050 relative to 2005 levels. Given the stringency of long-run targets and convexity of marginal abatement costs, the cost-minimizing time path for mitigation with banking suggests that 2025 abatement should exceed the pledged level under the Paris Agreement (42\% instead of 26--28\%) to reduce future costs. Total policy costs are approximately 30\% higher when banking is excluded; however, political economy barriers and uncertainty may limit the use of banking provisions despite their appeal on economic efficiency grounds. Banking on policy implementation with unlimited temporal flexibility may distort insights about the pace, extent, and economic impacts of future energy transitions associated with long-term abatement targets, especially for more stringent climate policies.},

This research presents an approach to quantify the economic value of variable renewable capacity and demonstrates its dependence on renewable deployment levels, regional resource endowments, fleet flexibility, and trade assumptions. It assesses economic and technical impacts of large-scale renewable penetration by linking two models, representing electric-sector investments and detailed operations. Model results for California and Texas suggest that operational constraints and costs of dispatchable generators (e.g., minimum load levels, ramping limits, startup costs) can impact renewable integration costs, but the temporal and spatial variability of solar and wind are larger determinants of their value. Restrictions on transmission and regional coordination in capacity planning and dispatch decrease the economic value of variable renewable energy, highlighting the potential roles of market design and trade. Energy storage is shown to be a valuable balancing asset at higher solar and wind penetration levels, but potential revenues diminish with increased storage deployment.}

Using a two-stage stochastic programming approach, model results suggest that the two most critical risks in the near-term planning process of the uncertainties considered here are natural gas prices and the stringency of climate policy. Stochastic strategies indicate that some near-term hedging from lower-cost wind and nuclear may occur but robustly demonstrate that delaying investment and waiting for more information can be optimal to avoid stranding capital-intensive assets. Hedging strategies protect against downside losses while retaining the option value of deferring irreversible commitments until more information is available about potentially lucrative market opportunities. These results are explained in terms of the optionality of investments in the electric power sector, leading to more general insights about uncertainty, learning, and irreversibility. The stochastic solution is especially valuable if decision-makers do not sufficiently account for the potential of climate constraints in future decades or if fuel price projections are outdated.}

  abstract = {Battery storage technologies have attracted attention from policymakers for their potential to reduce electric sector emissions by enabling greater wind and solar penetration. Yet existing studies indicate that adding energy storage actually increases emissions. The difference may be explained by the absence in the previous literature of ``investment effects'' -- changes in deployment of other generation technologies after storage is deployed. Our paper tests this hypothesis by evaluating battery-storage-induced emissions changes using a model that accounts for both long-run investment and dispatch effects simultaneously across regions in the United States, which can be used to separate the relative magnitudes of these two effects. Model results indicate that the investment effect dominates the dispatch effect under a range of sensitivities. We find that emissions may increase or decrease with battery storage, depending on policy and market assumptions, with reductions more likely in environments where wind and solar are more economically competitive relative to natural-gas-fired generation. These results suggest that existing studies that only account for operational impacts likely underestimate potential emissions changes from battery storage deployment.}

  abstract = {Technological change and policy support have heightened expectations for the role of energy storage in power systems, creating a need to enhance representations of energy storage in long-term models to inform decision-making. Energy storage technologies have complex and diverse cost, value, and performance characteristics that make them challenging to model, but there is limited guidance about best practices and research gaps for energy storage analysis. This paper reviews the literature and draws upon our collective experience to provide recommendations to analysts on approaches for representing energy storage in long-term electric sector models, navigating tradeoffs in model development, and identifying research gaps for existing tools and data. The review focuses on national-scale models with technological, temporal, and regional detail given their prevalence in planning and policy, though many insights are transferable to other modeling contexts. It also offers guidance to consumers of model outputs on proper use and interpretation based on model strengths and limitations. In particular, this review demonstrates the importance of capturing how the values of energy storage and other resources change as the system composition changes (e.g. with different levels of storage, renewables deployment, and emissions outcomes). These considerations require model detail like high spatiotemporal resolutions and endogenous investments that global integrated assessment models and price-taker frameworks do not typically resolve. Research gaps include linking tools of different resolutions, developing reduced-form representations of value streams, incorporating hybrid energy storage and renewable systems, and representing longer-duration energy storage technologies.},

Previous work has examined implications of carbon removal, primarily bioenergy-based technologies using integrated assessment models, but not investigated the effects of a portfolio of removal options on power systems in detail. Here, we explore impacts of carbon removal technologies on electric sector investments, costs, and emissions using a detailed capacity planning and dispatch model with hourly resolution. We show that adding carbon removal to a mix of low-carbon generation technologies lowers the costs of deep decarbonization. Changes to system costs and investments from including carbon removal are larger as policy ambition increases, reducing the dependence on technologies like advanced nuclear and long-duration storage. Bioenergy with carbon capture is selected for net-zero electric sector emissions targets, but direct air capture deployment increases as biomass supply costs rise.},

However, claims about economic and environmental impacts often lack transparency and may be based on incomplete metrics that can obscure differences in policy design. This paper examines model-based metrics used to assess the economic efficiency impacts of prospective electric sector policies. The appropriateness of alternative metrics varies by context, model, audience, and application, depending on the prioritization of comprehensiveness, measurability, transparency, and credible precision. This paper provides guidance for the modeling community on calculating and communicating cost metrics and for consumers of model outputs on interpreting these economic indicators. Using an illustrative example of clean electricity standards in the US power sector, model outputs highlight strengths and limitations of different cost metrics. Transformations of power systems with lower-carbon resources and zero-marginal-cost generation may entail shifts in when and where system costs are incurred, and given how these changes may not be appropriately reflected in metrics that were commonly reported in the past such as wholesale energy prices, showing a decomposition of system costs across standard reporting categories could be a more robust reporting practice. Ultimately, providing better metrics is only one element in a portfolio of transparency-related practices, and although it is insufficient by itself, such reporting can help to move dialogues in more productive directions and encourage better modeling practices.},

The dynamics of learning and irreversibility may give rise to an investment climate where strategic delay is optimal. Hedging strategies are shown to be sensitive to the specification of probability distributions for climate policy and natural gas prices, highlighting the important role of uncertainty quantification in future research. The paper also illustrates how this stochastic modeling framework could be used to quantify the value of limiting methane emissions from natural gas production.}

Recent decarbonization goals and rapid technological change have increased the need to appropriately represent economic characteristics and technical details of energy system resources, including variable renewable energy, energy storage technologies, carbon-capture-equipped capacity, and nuclear energy. Nuclear power represents about 20\% of electricity generation and 50\% of carbon-free electricity in the United States as of 2021. However, there are many perspectives on the role of existing and new nuclear in the future U.S. energy system, which is reflected in the broad range of potential contributions reported in the literature. This project aims to understand how issues central to nuclear energy are represented in long-term energy models. Building on earlier collaborations that focused on variable renewable energy and energy storage, this project convenes four modeling teams that use national-scale long-term energy system models from the Electric Power Research Institute, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to share methods and data, update models, run coordinated scenarios, and identify research needs. Improving tools can provide more insightful analyses and ensure that methods are more transparent.},

This paper investigates potential impacts of IRA on the power sector, which is the focus of many core IRA provisions. We summarize a multi-model comparison of IRA to identify robust findings and variation in power sector investments, emissions, and costs across 11 models of the U.S. energy system and electricity sector. Our results project that IRA incentives accelerate the deployment of low-emitting capacity, increasing average annual additions by up to 3.2 times current levels through 2035. CO2 emissions reductions from electricity generation across models range from 47\%--83\% below 2005 in 2030 (68\% average) and 66\%--87\% in 2035 (78\% average). Our higher clean electricity deployment and lower emissions under IRA, compared with earlier U.S. modeling, change the baseline for future policymaking and analysis. IRA helps to bring projected U.S. power sector and economy-wide emissions closer to near-term climate targets; however, no models indicate that these targets will be met with IRA alone, which suggests that additional policies, incentives, and private sector actions are needed.},

Emerging modeling studies examine how to achieve these net-zero goals, but differences across countries, model structures, and input assumptions make comparisons difficult. This perspective reviews insights from country-level studies on net-zero emissions systems. There is robust agreement on near-term ``low regrets'' strategies: rapid reduction of coal generation and expansion of renewables in the power sector; lower fossil fuel use; end-use efficiency improvements; electrification of end uses especially in transportation; and research, development, and deployment to buy down learning curves for emerging technologies that might be valuable for deeper decarbonization. However, although nearer-term trends are qualitatively similar, studies exhibit variation in decarbonization strategies, especially as net-zero goals are approached. Net-zero emissions targets lead to shifts toward clean electricity and declines in fossil fuel use, though magnitudes of these changes vary considerably across countries, models, and scenarios. This work also highlights modeling and analysis needs moving forward, including ways to provide more actionable information for stakeholders and research gaps where collaborations are increasingly valuable.}

The power sector generally has very low or negative emissions at the point where economy-wide net-zero emissions is reached, highlighting the importance of electricity decarbonization and the value of carbon removal in limiting costs of net-zero targets. End-use electrification can alter load shapes and impact electric sector planning and operations, but the scale of these changes in net-zero systems is uncertain.

Model results suggest that extensive deployment of advanced nuclear technologies would likely require a combination of new policies (especially carbon pricing), innovation in technologies to significantly lower capital and financing costs (likely below \$4000/kW), and innovation in business models to enable nonelectricity revenue streams. With policies targeting stringent emissions reductions, the presence of technologies like lower-cost advanced nuclear can reduce compliance costs by over 50\%. However, without strong policy support and in a market with low-cost renewables and gas, costs of advanced nuclear reactors would have to decrease substantially from current estimates to make them economically competitive by 2050.}

  abstract = {Power sector decarbonization is an important pillar of climate mitigation efforts, but perspectives differ about the relative competitiveness of generation technologies and how limited portfolio approaches (e.g., where nonrenewable generation options are prohibited) could alter the costs and likelihoods of reaching emissions reduction goals. The existing literature on impacts of technological availability and cost on electric sector planning typically use models that do not have sufficient technological, spatial, and temporal detail to adequately resolve the economic competitiveness of variable renewable energy vis-{\`a}-vis dispatchable generators. Using a state-of-theart energy-economic model, this work examines impacts of technological availability and advanced generation technologies on U.S. electricity market outcomes across a range of regional, market, and policy contexts. We show that decarbonization costs are 11\%--76\% higher as technological options are removed from consideration (incremental compliance costs for a 95\% CO2 reduction below 2005 levels are roughly twice as high when new nuclear, carbon-capture-equipped units, and transmission are not allowed). However, the economic and technical implications of limited portfolios depend on the market and policy contexts (e.g., costs are higher with stringent targets, more extensive end-use electrification, and lower gas prices) and the costs and capabilities of the remaining options. The analysis demonstrates how lower temporal and spatial resolution models likely understate the value of technology by omitting key economic and technical features of high variable renewable pathways. Additionally, the analysis quantifies how technological change can lower costs of emissions reductions by 7\%--73\% and how low-cost battery storage can provide a hedge against higher costs when technological portfolios are limited.},

  abstract = {An hourly energy balance analysis is presented of the Australian National Electricity Market in a 100\% renewable energy scenario, in which wind and photovoltaics (PV) provides about 90\% of the annual electricity demand and existing hydroelectricity and biomass provides the balance. Heroic assumptions about future technology development are avoided by only including technology that is being deployed in large quantities ({$>$}10 Gigawatts per year), namely PV and wind. Additional energy storage and stronger interconnection between regions was found to be necessary for stability. Pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) constitutes 97\% of worldwide electricity storage, and is adopted in this work. Many sites for closed loop PHES storage have been found in Australia. Distribution of PV and wind over 10--100 million hectares, utilising high voltage transmission, accesses different weather systems and reduces storage requirements (and overall cost). The additional cost of balancing renewable energy supply with demand on an hourly rather than annual basis is found to be modest: AU\$25--30/MWh (US\$19--23/MWh). Using 2016 prices prevailing in Australia, the levelised cost of renewable electricity (LCOE) with hourly balancing is estimated to be AU\$93/MWh (US\$70/MWh). LCOE is almost certain to decrease due to rapidly falling cost of wind and PV.}

We present a literature review of model-based analyses in this field, focusing on residential heating. We compare geographical and temporal research scopes and identify state-of-the-art analytical model formulations, particularly considering heat pumps and thermal storage. While numerical findings are idiosyncratic to specific assumptions, a synthesis of results indicates that power-to-heat technologies can cost-effectively contribute to fossil fuel substitution, renewable integration, and decarbonization. Heat pumps and passive thermal storage emerge as particularly favorable options.}

The study conducted a multi-model analysis that used co-optimized generation and transmission expansion planning and production cost modeling. Four transmission designs under eight scenarios were developed and studied to estimate costs and potential benefits. The results show benefit-to-cost ratios that reach as high as 2.5, indicating significant value to increasing the transmission capacity between the interconnections under the cases considered, realized through sharing generation resources and flexibility across regions.}

  abstract = {Many jurisdictions use net metering to record power exchanges between residential solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and the grid, thus valuing solar power at the electricity retail rate. However, if over the billing period, production exceeds consumption, the surplus remains freely available for consumption. In Wallonia (Belgium), the combination of net metering and generous subsidies for rooftop PV installation encouraged households to set-up large systems, possibly exceeding their consumption needs. We test this potential rebound effect with a large sample of residential PV installations. We observe that a large proportion of households oversize their installation to benefit from the subsidies and, later consume most of their excess production. The effect is econometrically highly significant. There is thus evidence of a strong increase in energy consumption by residential PV owners, which runs counter to the original policy design.}

  abstract = {For the successful transition to a renewable energy source powered society, coupling of different energy sectors is inevitable. The extreme case of a future German energy system consisting of power, heat and gas consumers supplied with 100 \% renewables is analyzed here. To find the most cost-effective system configuration, different combinations of storage and conversion technologies are compared by performing dynamic simulations and evaluating the average costs over the period of one year. Renewable power production is modeled by using actual power-generation curves and extrapolating the installed power for each technology according to the German energy system framework. Final energy curves for power, heat and gas demand are created as a result of the study. The gas demand only arises from industries using hydrocarbons as a product in processes and for high temperature process heat. The components of the energy system, e.g. storage and conversion technologies are modeled using the equation-based open-source TransiEnt Library based on Modelica{\textregistered}. To obtain the boundaries of the solution scope, the comparison is started by analyzing homogeneous scenarios, e.g. All-Electric or All-Gas with Power-to-Gas with reconversion to power and heat. To find the optimal configuration within this scope, different combinations of power (adiabatic compressed air energy storage (A-CAES), lithium-ion battery, pumped hydro storage), heat storage (hot water storage) and gas storage (underground storage) technologies as well as conversion technologies, i.e. Power-to-Gas (electrolyzer with methanation), Power-to-Heat (electric heat pump, electric boiler), Gas-to-Heat (gas boiler, gas heat pump), and Gas-to-Power (gas turbine, combined cycle gas turbine) are simulated. The results show that a homogeneous energy system configuration where all services are supplied by either power or gas are technically possible but not economic. Due to the limited technical potential of renewables, ecological feasibility of All-Gas systems is limited. A combination of Power-to-Gas with combined cycle gas turbines, electric heat pumps, a lithium-ion battery and pumped hydro storage is the option with the lowest cost. Using an A-CAES instead of the battery or adding an A-CAES to the battery does not lower the cost.}

  abstract = {In order to define a cost optimal 100\% renewable energy system, an hourly resolved model has been created based on linear optimization of energy system parameters under given constrains. The model is comprised of five scenarios for 100\% renewable energy power systems in North-East Asia with different high voltage direct current transmission grid development levels, including industrial gas demand and additional energy security. Renewables can supply enough energy to cover the estimated electricity and gas demands of the area in the year 2030 and deliver more than 2000TWhth of heat on a cost competitive level of 84{\texteuro}/MWhel for electricity. Further, this can be accomplished for a synthetic natural gas price at the 2013 Japanese liquefied natural gas import price level and at no additional generation costs for the available heat. The total area system cost could reach 69.4{\texteuro}/MWhel, if only the electricity sector is taken into account. In this system about 20\% of the energy is exchanged between the 13 regions, reflecting a rather decentralized character which is supplied 27\% by stored energy. The major storage technologies are batteries for daily storage and power-to-gas for seasonal storage. Prosumers are likely to play a significant role due to favourable economics. A highly resilient energy system with very high energy security standards would increase the electricity cost by 23\% to 85.6{\texteuro}/MWhel. The results clearly show that a 100\% renewable energy based system is feasible and lower in cost than nuclear energy and fossil carbon capture and storage alternatives.}

  abstract = {Transition towards 100\% renewable energy supply is a challenging aim for many regions in the world. Even in regions with excellent availability of wind and solar resources, such factors as limited availability of flexible renewable energy resources, low flexibility of demand, and high seasonality of energy supply and demand can impede the transition. All these factors can be found for the case of Kazakhstan, a mostly steppe country with harsh continental climate conditions and an energy intensive economy dominated by fossil fuels. Results of the simulation using the LUT Energy System Transition modelling tool show that even under these conditions, the power and heat supply system of Kazakhstan can transition towards 100\% renewable energy by 2050. A renewable-based electricity only system will be lower in cost than the existing fossil-based system, with levelised cost of electricity of 54 {\texteuro}/MWh in 2050. The heat system transition requires installation of substantial storage capacities to compensate for seasonal heat demand variations. Electrical heating will become the main source of heat for both district and individual heating sectors with heat cost of about 45 {\texteuro}/MWh and electricity cost of around 56 {\texteuro}/MWh for integrated sectors in 2050. According to these results, transition towards a 100\% renewable power and heat supply system is technically feasible and economically viable even in countries with harsh climatic conditions.}

Often medium sized reactors with power less than 700 MWe are also grouped into this category. Internationally, the development of a variety of designs for SMRs is booming with many designs approaching maturity and even in or nearing the licensing stage. It is for this reason that a generalized yet comprehensive economic model for first of a kind (FOAK) through nth of a kind (NOAK) SMRs based upon rated power, plant configuration, and the fiscal environment was developed. In the model, a particular project's feasibility is assessed with regards to market conditions and by commonly utilized capital budgeting techniques, such as the net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), Payback, and more importantly, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for comparison to other energy production technologies. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effects of changing debt, equity, interest rate, and conditions on the LCOE.},

  abstract = {Unlike natural gas-fired generation, renewable generation (e.g., from wind, solar, and geothermal power) is largely immune to fuel price risk. If ratepayers are rational and value long-term price stability, then---contrary to common practice---any comparison of the levelized cost of renewable to gas-fired generation should be based on a hedged gas price input, rather than an uncertain gas price forecast. This paper compares natural gas prices that can be locked in through futures, swaps, and physical supply contracts to contemporaneous long-term forecasts of spot gas prices. We find that from 2000 to 2003, forward gas prices for terms of 2--10 years have been considerably higher than most contemporaneous long-term gas price forecasts. This difference is striking, and implies that comparisons between renewable and gas-fired generation based on these forecasts over this period have arguably yielded results that are biased in favor of gas-fired generation.}

  abstract = {Berkeley Lab's ``Utility-Scale Solar, 2022 Edition'' provides an overview of key trends in the U.S. market, with a focus on 2021. Highlights of this year's update include: -A record of nearly 12.5 GWAC of new utility-scale PV capacity came online in 2021, bringing cumulative installed capacity to more than 51.3 GWAC across 44 states. -90\% of all new utility-scale PV capacity added in 2021 uses single-axis tracking. -Median installed project costs declined to \$1.35/WAC (or \$1.02/WDC) in 2021. -Project-level capacity factors vary widely, from 9\% to 35\% (on an AC basis), with a sample median of 24\%. The report explores drivers of this variation. -Utility-scale PV's LCOE fell to \$33/MWh in 2021 (\$27/MWh if factoring in the federal investment tax credit, or ITC). -PPA prices have largely followed the decline in solar's LCOE over time, but have recently stagnated and even moved slightly higher. Prices from a sample of recent contracts average around \$20/MWh (levelized) in the West and \$30-40/MWh elsewhere in the continental US. In 2021, solar's average market value (defined in the report to include only energy and capacity value) rose by 55\% to \$47/MWh and exceeded average wholesale prices in 13 of the 17 balancing authorities analyzed. -Adding battery storage is one way to increase the value of solar. Our public data file tracks metadata and PPA prices from 67 PV+battery hybrid projects that are already online or that have secured offtake arrangements. -At the end of 2021, there were at least 674 GW of utility-scale solar power capacity within the interconnection queues across the nation, 284 GW of which include batteries.

  abstract = {Introducing large amounts of electricity produced from variable renewable energy sources such as wind and solar decreases wholesale electricity price while increasing the volatility of the market. These conditions drive the need for peak-load power generation, while regulation requirements fuel the push for flexible power generation. The increase of variable renewable energy in the market share, along with falling natural gas prices, makes nuclear power plants less competitive. Thermal storage is being considered to increase the nuclear power plant revenue. Thermal storage increases the flexibility of the nuclear plant system without sacrificing its efficiency. There are multiple opportunities to increase the nuclear power plant revenue, including increased capacity payments, arbitrage, and ancillary services. An economic analysis was performed to investigate the revenue increase of the system with thermal storage. The investment cost was assessed, and net present value was evaluated for the considered scenarios. Two system designs were considered in the analysis: a thermal storage system using the existing power conversion infrastructure and an integrated design with thermal storage fully incorporated into the reactor system design. The preliminary analysis showed that introducing a thermal storage system is profitable for some scenarios considered. Profitability depends significantly on the storage size, output flexibility, share of variable renewable energy, and market characteristics.}

By means of a large set of simulations we aim to assess the implications of these subjective distributions of technological costs over key model outputs. We are able to detect what sources of technology uncertainty are more influential, how this differs across models, and whether and how results are affected by the time horizon, the metric considered or the stringency of the climate policy. In unconstrained emission scenarios, within the range of future technology performances considered in the present analysis, the cost of nuclear energy is shown to dominate all others in affecting future emissions. Climate-constrained scenarios, stress the relevance, in addition to that of nuclear energy, of biofuels, as they represent the main source of decarbonization of the transportation sector and bioenergy, since the latter can be coupled with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to produce negative emissions.}

With relatively small amounts of intermittent generation, reliability impacts may not be detectable; however, as renewable integration goals continue to increase, the standards associated with renewable integration should be revisited. The Effective Load Carrying Capability (ELCC) is one methodology that should be carefully reviewed. Current practices in utilizing the ELCC may reflect how intermittent resources have historically contributed to a system, but use of ELCC in its present form to predict future resource requirements may be misleading and result in a system with less than desirable reliability. This paper discusses several concerns regarding the ELCC calculation, including shifts to a higher Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) on peak and exaggerating capacity contribution at peak.}

Storage devices are expected to smooth over the non-simultaneous production of volatile renewable energies and their consumption. In this paper, we investigate to what extent domestic photovoltaic-battery systems can compensate the capping of the feed-in power by buffering the peak energy. The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) in Freiburg, Germany, has developed a novel forecast-based control scheme for photovoltaic-battery systems. It estimates the photovoltaic excess energy and derives a charging schedule for the battery to store the energy from the photovoltaic peak-production. The maximal self-consumption of the locally produced renewable energy is thereby not affected. We show that the maximal photovoltaic feed-in power can be reduced from 70 \% to 60 \% of the nominal photovoltaic power without losses.}

Yet, in integrated assessment models (IAMs) that determine the social cost of carbon (SCC) and prescribe optimal climate policy, human mortality impacts are limited and not updated to the latest scientific understanding. This study extends the DICE-2016 IAM to explicitly include temperature-related mortality impacts by estimating a climate-mortality damage function. We introduce a metric, the mortality cost of carbon (MCC), that estimates the number of deaths caused by the emissions of one additional metric ton of CO2. In the baseline emissions scenario, the 2020 MCC is 2.26 {\texttimes} 10-4 [low to high estimate~-1.71{\texttimes} 10-4 to 6.78 {\texttimes} 10-4] excess deaths per metric ton of 2020 emissions. This implies that adding 4,434 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2020---equivalent to the lifetime emissions of 3.5 average Americans---causes one excess death globally in expectation between 2020-2100. Incorporating mortality costs increases the 2020 SCC from \$37 to \$258 [-\$69 to \$545] per metric ton in the baseline emissions scenario.~Optimal climate policy changes from gradual emissions reductions starting in 2050 to full decarbonization by 2050 when mortality is considered.},

Proximity raster layers were derived from features including roads, power lines, and rivers then overlain with 10~{\texttimes}~10~m raster terrain datasets including slope and potential irradiance to produce a high resolution map showing solar energy potential from ``poor'' to ``excellent'' for high potential counties across the southwestern United States. Similar maps were produced by adding social acceptance data collected from a series of surveys showing the potential public resistance to development that can be expected in areas of high solar energy suitability. Applying social preferences to the model significantly reduced the amount of suitable area in each of the selected study areas. The methods demonstrated are expected to help reduce time, money, and resources currently allocated toward finding and assessing areas of high solar power suitability.}

  abstract = {Research on 100\% renewable energy systems is a relatively recent phenomenon. It was initiated in the mid-1970s, catalyzed by skyrocketing oil prices. Since the mid-2000s, it has quickly evolved into a prominent research field encompassing an expansive and growing number of research groups and organizations across the world. The main conclusion of most of these studies is that 100\% renewables is feasible worldwide at low cost. Advanced concepts and methods now enable the field to chart realistic as well as cost- or resource-optimized and efficient transition pathways to a future without the use of fossil fuels. Such proposed pathways in turn, have helped spur 100\% renewable energy policy targets and actions, leading to more research. In most transition pathways, solar energy and wind power increasingly emerge as the central pillars of a sustainable energy system combined with energy efficiency measures. Cost-optimization modeling and greater resource availability tend to lead to higher solar photovoltaic shares, while emphasis on energy supply diversification tends to point to higher wind power contributions. Recent research has focused on the challenges and opportunities regarding grid congestion, energy storage, sector coupling, electrification of transport and industry implying power-to-X and hydrogen-to-X, and the inclusion of natural and technical carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approaches. The result is a holistic vision of the transition towards a net-negative greenhouse gas emissions economy that can limit global warming to 1.5{$^\circ$}C with a clearly defined carbon budget in a sustainable and cost-effective manner based on 100\% renewable energy-industry-CDR systems. Initially, the field encountered very strong skepticism. Therefore, this paper also includes a response to major critiques against 100\% renewable energy systems, and also discusses the institutional inertia that hampers adoption by the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as well as possible negative connections to community acceptance and energy justice. We conclude by discussing how this emergent research field can further progress to the benefit of society.}

  abstract = {The global energy system has to be transformed towards high levels of sustainability in order to comply with the COP21 agreement. Solar photovoltaic (PV) offers excellent characteristics to play a major role in this energy transition. The key objective of this work is to investigate the role of PV in the global energy transition based on respective scenarios and a newly introduced energy transition model developed by the authors. A progressive group of energy transition scenarios present results of a fast growth of installed PV capacities and a high energy supply share of solar energy to the total primary energy demand in the world in the decades to come. These progressive energy transition scenarios can be confirmed. For the very first time, a full hourly modelling for an entire year is performed for the world, subdivided in 145 sub-regions, which is required to reflect the intermittent character of the future energy system. The model derives total installed solar PV capacity requirements of 7.1--9.1 TWp for the electricity sector (as of the year 2015) and 27.4 TWp for the entire energy system in the mid-term. The long-term capacity is expected to be 42 TWp and, because of the ongoing cost reduction of PV and battery technologies, this value is found to be the lower limit for the installed capacities. Solar PV electricity is expected to be the largest, least cost and most relevant source of energy in the mid-term to long-term for the global energy supply.

  abstract = {In electricity storage valuation studies, the lack of the (efficient) aggregation of applications in a single operation strategy is usually identified as a major barrier. Determining the true value of storage requires the aggregation of applications while accounting for the interdependence between revenue streams. Individual applications cannot simply be added together, but need to be co-optimized since they can interfere with each other. This article's contributions are threefold. First, we provide model formulations to aggregate multiple arbitrage opportunities, and to quantify the accompanying potential arbitrage value. Whereas the storage arbitrage literature focuses on the capturing of price differences over time for the day-ahead market, we consider all three short-term markets, i.e., the day-ahead, intra-day, and real-time markets, and we consider the opportunity to capture three types of price differences: (1) over time in each individual market, (2) over the three markets for the same time step, and (3) over time over the three markets. Second, an important assumption in arbitrage models is related to whether storage operators recognize that their actions may affect those prices. This price-effect of storage actions has been considered before for the day-ahead market, but not for the intra-day and real-time markets. We study the price-effect with high detail for all three short-term markets, based on real-world price and volume data. Third, we apply the developed models to the four market zones of the Central Western European region, i.e., the Belgian, French, German, and Dutch market zones, while elaborating on the price-effect for the Belgian zone. As such, this article provides insight in the extent to which the three short-term markets, and their combination, in these market zones are potentially interesting for storage arbitrage. This assists improved decision-making of market participants in storage investment and operation, and informs policy-makers about the impact of market design on the potential storage value.}

This transformation is poised to continue given decreasing technology costs and ambitious decarbonization goals at the federal, state, local, corporate, and consumer levels. The North American Renewable Integration Study (NARIS) aims to inform grid planners, utilities, industry, policymakers, and other stakeholders about challenges and opportunities for continental system integration of large amounts of wind, solar, and hydropower to support a low-carbon future grid. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) conducted a detailed, continent-wide analysis with planning scenarios of transmission, generation, and demand to reach 80\%--92\% carbon reductions (from 2005) for the Canadian electric power system, and up to 80\% reductions continent-wide. We used a suite of models to study future scenarios and gain insights, including potential impacts on costs, emissions, resource adequacy, and the specific technologies that help enable the transition to a low-carbon grid. Our analysis had a particular focus on the potential role of cooperation among the three North American countries and between regions within each country, and how transmission can support sharing of supply and demand diversity. The NARIS project began in 2016. This report describes a U.S. perspective in coordination with the U.S. Department of Energy, and a companion report describes a Canadian perspective in coordination with the Natural Resources Canada. NARIS was an extension of a previous body of work, including the Western Wind and Solar Integration Study, the Eastern Renewable Generation Integration Study, Interconnections Seam Study, and the Pan Canadian Wind Integration Study. NARIS analyzed the entire continent in detail while studying higher renewable generation than previous studies.}

  abstract = {In response to near- and long-term market and policy shifts, power systems are integrating increasingly-distant renewable energy resources. No analyses quantify the spatial heterogeneity of resource adequacy contributions of renewables at the interconnection-scale in the United States, which would indicate the value to resource adequacy of integrating increasingly-distant renewables. To fill this gap, we develop a Monte Carlo-based probabilistic reliability model to estimate the effective load carrying capability (ELCC) of wind or solar generators. We apply our model to estimate the ELCCs of new solar or wind generators at 1406 locations across the Western Interconnection when contributing to each of five power pools within the Interconnection. Across the five power pools, we find solar ELCCs range from 0\% to 44\% and wind ELCCs range from 0\% to 55\% across the Western Interconnection. Solar ELCCs increase from east to west for all but one power pool, incentivizing integration of western renewables into eastern power pools. Deploying storage with wind or solar generators increases their ELCCs, with larger increases occurring at locations with lower renewable-only ELCC values. Thus, resource adequacy gains from deploying storage with renewables can partly substitute for those from integrating increasingly-distant renewables.}

  abstract = {Large power sector CO2 emission reductions are needed to meet long-term climate change targets. Intermittent renewable energy sources (intermittent-RES) such as wind and solar PV can be a key component of the resulting low-carbon power systems. Their intermittency will require more flexibility from the rest of the power system to maintain system stability. In this study, the efficacy of five complementary options to integrate intermittent-RES at the lowest cost is evaluated with the PLEXOS hourly power system simulation tool for Western Europe in the year 2050. Three scenarios to reduce CO2 emissions by 96\% and maintain system reliability are investigated: 40\%, 60\% and 80\% of annual power generation by RES. This corresponds to 22\%, 41\% and 59\% of annual power generation by intermittent-RES. This study shows that higher penetration of RES will increase the total system costs: they increase by 12\% between the 40\% and 80\% RES scenarios. Key drivers are the relatively high investment costs and integration costs of intermittent-RES. It is found that total system costs can be reduced by: (1) Demand response (DR) (2--3\% reduction compared to no DR deployment); (2) natural gas-fired power plants with and without Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) (12\% reduction from mainly replacing RES power generation between the 80\% and 40\% RES scenarios); (3) increased interconnection capacity (0--1\% reduction compared to the current capacity); (4) curtailment (2\% reduction in 80\% RES scenario compared to no curtailment); (5) electricity storage increases total system costs in all scenarios (0.1--3\% increase compared to only current storage capacity). The charging costs and investment costs make storage relatively expensive, even projecting cost reductions of 40\% for Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) and 70\% for batteries compared to 2012. All scenarios are simulated as energy only markets, and experience a ``revenue gap'' for both complementary options and other power generators: only curtailment and DR are profitable due to their low cost. The revenue gap becomes progressively more pronounced in the 60\% and 80\% RES scenarios, as the low marginal costs of RES reduce electricity prices.}

  abstract = {Future power systems will require large shares of low-carbon generators such as renewables and power plants with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to keep global warming below 2 {$^\circ$}C. Intermittent renewables increase the system-wide demand for flexibility and affect the operation of thermal power plants. We investigate the operation of future power plants by first composing a comprehensive overview of the operational flexibility of current and future power plants. Next, a combined long-term optimization and hourly simulation is performed with the soft-linked MARKAL-NL-UU and REPOWERS models for The Netherlands in 2030 and 2050. We quantify and compare the technical and economic performance of power plants for four distinctly different future scenarios. We find that future low-carbon power systems will have large shares of intermittent renewable sources (19--42\%) and also a 2--38\% higher variability in residual load compared to the Baseline scenario. Hence, power plant operation will be more variable, which reduces their efficiency by 0.6--1.6\% compared to the full-load efficiency. Enough flexibility is present in future power systems to accommodate renewables, due to advances in power plant flexibility and interconnectors. As a result, generators with CCS have a large market share (23--64\% of power generated). Moreover, the current energy-based market model generates insufficient revenues: the price received per MWh covers only 84\% ({\textpm}30\%) of the total generation costs per MWh of 77 {\texteuro}/MWh ({\textpm}12{\texteuro}). This will discourage new investments in generation capacity and reduce power system adequacy. New or additional market designs may be required to ensure system adequacy in future power systems.}

  abstract = {Capacity expansion models for the electric power system often employ zonal (rather than nodal) resolution, necessitating estimates of aggregate power transfer limits across the interfaces between model zones. Interface limits between planning areas are sometimes published, but they are not generalizable to arbitrary zone shapes. There is thus a need for a reproducible method for estimating interface transfer limits (ITLs) between user-defined zones directly from nodal transmission system data. Here, we present a simple method for estimating ITLs using a DC power flow approximation via the power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) matrix. Linear optimization is performed to identify the distribution of power flows that maximizes the total flow on interfacecrossing lines, subject to individual line ratings, limits on bus injection/withdrawal, and the relationships among flows, injections, and withdrawals imposed by the PTDF matrix. We demonstrate the application of the method on a 134-zone {$\sim$}65 000-bus system, and we explore the influence of flow direction, contingency level, and zone size on the estimated ITLs. There is significant heterogeneity in the ratio of the ITL to the sum of interface-crossing line ratings, which highlights the importance of accounting for the physical constraints on power flows imposed by Kirchhoff's laws when estimating zonal ITLs.},

Many studies perform time series aggregation using clustering algorithms to reduce the temporal dimension, but when modeling continent-scale electricity systems that are large enough to contain multiple independent weather systems, this approach requires large numbers of representative periods to minimize errors in regional wind and solar capacity factors. Here, a new optimization-based approach for representative period selection and weighting is introduced that minimizes regional errors in average renewable capacity factors and electricity demand. The method delivers higher regional fidelity with fewer representative periods than alternative clustering methods when applied to wind, solar, and demand profiles for the contiguous United States. When representative periods are selected from multiple weather years, the optimized method reproduces regional averages with lower error than a complete 365-day time series from any single weather year. The method identifies only representative (as opposed to outlying) periods but can be combined with an iterative ``stress period'' identification approach to guide efficient decision-making considering both average and high-risk weather conditions.},

Here we analyse the authors' methodology and find it problematic. The feasibility criteria chosen by the authors are important, but are also easily addressed at low economic cost, while not affecting the main conclusions of the reviewed studies and certainly not affecting their technical feasibility. A more thorough review reveals that all of the issues have already been addressed in the engineering and modelling literature. Nuclear power, which the authors have evaluated positively elsewhere, faces other, genuine feasibility problems, such as the finiteness of uranium resources and a reliance on unproven technologies in the medium- to long-term. Energy systems based on renewables, on the other hand, are not only feasible, but already economically viable and decreasing in cost every year.}

Full transmission costs are left out of many studies; distribution and administration costs are similarly excluded or highly simplified. Here, we present a detailed bottom-up accounting method for projecting future retail electricity rates in the United States. Making the simplifying assumption that each state is served by an investor-owned utility (IOU), we translate projected generation and transmission capacity and costs from the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) capacity-expansion model into IOU balance sheet expenditures, accounting for depreciation, taxes, and the breakdown between operating and capitalized (rate-based) expenses. Distribution, administration, and intra-regional transmission costs are projected forward based on empirical trends over the past decade. Modeled bottom-up electricity rates are compared to historical rates from 2010-2019, and the sensitivity of modeled rates to a range of financing and modeling assumptions is explored. Distribution and administration rate components account for roughly 40\% (4.4 ¢/kWh) of the projected national-average retail rate over 2020-2050 under central assumptions.},

In this paper both cross-sector and cross-border integration are considered in the model PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30, the first open, spatially-resolved, temporallyresolved and sector-coupled energy model of Europe. Using a simplified network with one node per country, the cost-optimal system is calculated for a 95\% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to 1990, incorporating electricity, transport and heat demand. Flexibility from battery electric vehicles (BEV), power-to-gas units (P2G) and long-term thermal energy storage (LTES) make a significant contribution to the smoothing of variability from wind and solar and to the reduction of total system costs. The cost-minimising integration of BEV pairs well with the daily variations of solar power, while P2G and LTES balance the synoptic and seasonal variations of demand and renewables. In all scenarios, an expansion of cross-border transmission reduces system costs, but the more tightly the energy sectors are coupled, the weaker the benefit of transmission reinforcement becomes.},

Here, we use a high-resolution national-scale capacityexpansion model to explore electricity-system-cost-minimizing deployment of PV-wind hybrid systems across the United States (U.S.) in scenarios that achieve a zero-carbon electricity mix in 2040. While overall system cost savings resulting from hybridization are relatively small---roughly 0.8\% for baseline interconnection cost as\- sumptions and {$<$}2\% for sensitivity cases with high interconnection costs---there are notable shifts in deployment patterns when hybridization is allowed. PV capacity is often relocated to sites where wind capacity and asso\- ciated interconnection capacity is already deployed, and ``overbuilding'' of nameplate PV and wind capacity relative to point-of-interconnection capacity is observed to increase with rising interconnection costs. Roughly 300 gigawatts (GW) of point-of-interconnection capacity (over 500 GW of nameplate PV and wind capacity) are deployed at hybrid installations with PV:wind capacity ratios between 1:3 and 3:1 in modeled zero-carbon power systems across the U.S.},

We examine the historical adoption of nuclear power as a case of a complex large scale energy technology. We conduct an event history analysis of grid connections of first sizable commercial nuclear power reactors in 79 countries between 1950 and 2018. We show that the introduction of nuclear power can largely be explained by contextual variables such as the proximity of a country to a major technology supplier (`ease of diffusion'), the size of the economy, electricity demand growth, and energy import dependence (`market attractiveness'). The lack of nuclear newcomers in the early 1990s can be explained by the lack of countries with high growth in electricity demand and sufficient capacities to build their first nuclear power plant, either on their own or with international help. We also find that nuclear accidents, the pursuit of nuclear weapons, and the advances made in competing technologies played only a minor role in nuclear technology failing to be established in more countries. Our analysis improves understanding of the feasibility of introducing contested and expensive technologies in a heterogenous world with motivations and capacities that differ across countries and by a patchwork of international relations. While countries with high state capacity or support from a major technology supplier are capable of introducing large-scale technologies quickly, technology diffusion to other regions might undergo significant delays due to lower motivations and capacities.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we studied the aggregation techniques for power capacity expansion problems. Combining a growing demand for green energy with a hard constraint on demand satisfaction causes system flexibility to be a major challenge in designing a stable energy system. To determine both the need for flexibility and which technologies that could satisfy these needs at minimum cost, the system should be analyzed on an hour-by-hour scale for a long period of time. This often leads to computationally intractable problems. One way of getting more tractable models is to aggregate the time domain. Many different aggregation techniques have been developed, all with a common goal of selecting representative time slices to be used instead of the full time scale, gaining a problem size reduction in the number of variables and/or constraints. The art of aggregation is to balance the computational difficulty against the solution quality, making validation of the techniques crucial. We propose new aggregation techniques and compare these to each other and to a selection of aggregation techniques from the literature. We validate the aggregated problems against the non-aggregated problems and look into the sensitivity of the performance of the aggregation techniques to different data sets and to the selection of different element types. Our analysis shows that aggregation techniques can be used to achieve very good solutions in a short amount of time, and that simple aggregation techniques achieve good performance similar to that of techniques with higher complexity. Even though the aggregation techniques in this paper are applied to power capacity expansion models, the methodology can be used for other problems with similar time dependence, and we believe that results in agreement with the results seen here, would be achieved.},

We present a sensitivity analysis methodology that studies how different problem changes, influence the aggregation technique performances. The performance is measured as the ability of the aggregated problem to fully or partially replicate the solution achieved by the non-aggregated problem. The applicability of the methodology is illustrated through a case study considering three types of problem changes namely changes in the wind availability, changes in the aggregated problem size, and changes in the energy system design. By applying the suggested methodology to ten different aggregation techniques, key properties which seem to ensure promising performance are identified.},

  abstract = {We model many combinations of renewable electricity sources (inland wind, offshore wind, and photovoltaics) with electrochemical storage (batteries and fuel cells), incorporated into a large grid system (72~GW). The purpose is twofold: 1) although a single renewable generator at one site produces intermittent power, we seek combinations of diverse renewables at diverse sites, with storage, that are not intermittent and satisfy need a given fraction of hours. And 2) we seek minimal cost, calculating true cost of electricity without subsidies and with inclusion of external costs. Our model evaluated over 28 billion combinations of renewables and storage, each tested over 35,040~h (four years) of load and weather data. We find that the least cost solutions yield seemingly-excessive generation capacity---at times, almost three times the electricity needed to meet electrical load. This is because diverse renewable generation and the excess capacity together meet electric load with less storage, lowering total system cost. At 2030 technology costs and with excess electricity displacing natural gas, we find that the electric system can be powered 90\%--99.9\% of hours entirely on renewable electricity, at costs comparable to today's---but only if we optimize the mix of generation and storage technologies.}

  abstract = {This article reviews the current status and future prospects of commercial nuclear electric power, with emphasis on issues of safety, physical security, proliferation, and economics. Discussions of these issues are presented separately for the current operating fleet, for new reactor designs similar in size to the current fleet, and for prospective new reactors of substantially smaller size. This article also discusses the issue of expansion of commercial nuclear power into new countries. The article concludes with recommendations, related both to technical issues and policy considerations. The major implications for policy are that although the level of safety and security achieved in today's operating reactor fleet worldwide is considered broadly acceptable, some advanced designs now under development potentially offer demonstrably safer performance, and may offer improved financial performance also. Management and safety culture are vital attributes for achieving adequate safety and security, as are a strong political culture that includes an absence of corruption, an independent regulatory authority, and a separation of nuclear operation from day-to-day politics. In some countries that are now considering a nuclear-power program for the first time, careful attention to these attributes will be essential for success.},

In the 21st century, the world faces the novel challenge of drastically reducing emissions of greenhouse gases while simultaneously expanding energy access and economic opportunity to billions of people. We examine this challenge in the electricity sector, which has been widely identified as an early candidate for deep decarbonization. In most regions, serving the projected electricity demand in 2050 while simultaneously reducing emissions will require a mix of electrical generation assets different from the current system. Although a variety of low- or zero-carbon technologies can be employed, our analysis demonstrates the potential contribution nuclear can make as a dispatchable low-carbon technology. The least-cost portfolios in our analysis include an important share for nuclear, the magnitude of which grows significantly as its cost drops. Therefore, there are strong incentives for industry to reduce the cost of new nuclear plants, and here we identify promising approaches for achieving such cost reductions. We recommend that governments create policies that equally recognize the environmental and societal benefits of all low-carbon energy technologies. Without a balanced portfolio of dispatchable and variable energy sources, the cost and difficulty of achieving decarbonization targets increases significantly.}

  abstract = {Electricity tariffs typically charge residential users a volumetric rate that covers the bulk of energy, transmission, and distribution costs. The resulting prices, charged per unit of electricity consumed, do not reflect marginal costs and vary little across time and space. The emergence of distributed energy resources---such as solar photovoltaics and energy storage---has sparked interest among regulators and utilities in reforming electricity tariffs to enable more efficient utilization of these resources. The economic pressure to redesign electricity rates is countered by concerns of how more efficient rate structures might impact different socioeconomic groups. We analyze the bill impacts of alternative rate plans using interval metering data for more than 100,000 customers in the Chicago, Illinois area. We combine these data with granular Census data to assess the incidence of bill changes across different socioeconomic groups. We find that low-income customers would face bill increases on average in a transition to more economically efficient electricity tariffs. However, we demonstrate that simple changes to fixed charges in two-part tariffs can mitigate these disparities while preserving all, or the vast majority, of the efficiency gains. These designs rely exclusively on observable information and could be replicated by utilities in many geographies across the U.S.}

  abstract = {Driven1 by decreasing prices for photovoltaic (PV) systems and incentive programs of different governments almost 100 GW of PV and over 100 GW of wind turbines (WT) have been integrated in the European power system today (2014). In some areas, the electricity generation already exceeds the demand, pushing the existing transport infrastructure to its limits in certain hours. In order to reach the European Commission's targets for 2050, the system integration will at some point require flexibility sources independent of conventional generation in order to keep today's standard in security of supply. There are several sources of flexibility. Together these flexibility sources will ensure the match of demand and supply at any given time. Energy storage systems can provide this flexibility by shifting of load in time while transmission grids provide the shift of load in space. Up to a certain extent, transmission capacity and storage capacity can replace each other, i.e. storage can reduce the load on transmission infrastructure by mitigating local peaks in load and/or generation. For the transition to a fully renewable energy system in 2050, major changes have to be achieved in the structure of the power supply system. The simulation tool GENESYS is a holistic approach to optimize the allocation and size of different generation technologies, storage systems and transnational grids of a European power system. The source code for the simulation tool is available free of charge under a public license. It can be freely parameterized by the user which allows the study of different electricity systems under the users' assumptions with regard to load, generation potential and cost structure of the different system components. This publication will give an introduction to the simulation framework, the system model and the optimization strategy. Optimization results obtained with GENESYS for a fully renewable electricity system and a cost structure expected for 2050 will be presented together with sensitivity analyses investigating the main assumptions. The focus is the optimal allocation of PV and WT in a European electricity system, the resulting demand for storage capacities of different technologies and the capacity of the overlay grid.}

Such a system is characterized by the need for a strongly interconnected energy transport grid as well as a high demand of energy storage capacities to compensate the time fluctuating characteristic of most RE generation technologies. With the RE generators at the location of high harvest potential, the appropriate dimension of storage and transmission system between different regions, a cost efficient system can be achieved. To find the preferred target system, the optimization tool GENESYS (Genetic Optimization of a European Energy System) was developed. The example calculations under the assumption of 100\% self-supply, show a need of about 2,500 GW RES in total, a storage capacity of about 240,000 GWh, corresponding to 6\% of the annual energy demand, and a HVDC transmission grid of 375,000 GWkm. The combined cost for generation, storage and transmission excluding distribution, was estimated to be 6.87 ct/kWh.}

  abstract = {To address the need for regularly updated wind resource data, NREL has processed the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) outputs for use in grid integration modeling. The HRRR is an hourly-updated operational forecast product produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (Dowell et al., 2022). Several barriers have prevented the HRRR's widespread proliferation in the wind energy industry: missing timesteps (prior to 2019), challenging file format for wind energy analysis, limited vertical height resolution, and negative bias versus legacy WIND Toolkit data (2007-2013). NREL has applied re-gridding, interpolation, and bias-correction to the native HRRR data to overcome these limitations. This results in the now-publicly-available bias corrected and interpolated HRRR (BC-HRRR) dataset for weather years 2015 to 2023. Bias correction is necessary for wind resource consistency across weather years to be used simultaneously in planning-focused grid integration studies alongside the original WIND Toolkit data. We show that quantile mapping with the WIND Toolkit as a historical baseline is an effective method for bias correcting the interpolated HRRR data: the BC-HRRR has reduced mean bias versus comparable gridded wind resource datasets (+0.12 m/s versus Vortex) and has very low mean bias versus ground measurement stations (+0.01 m/s) (Buster et al., 2024). BC-HRRR's consistency with the legacy WIND Toolkit allows NREL to extend grid integration analysis to 15+ weather years of wind data with low-overhead extensibility to future years as they are made available by NOAA. As with historical datasets like the WIND Toolkit, BC-HRRR is intended for use in grid integration modeling (e.g., capacity expansion, production cost, and resource adequacy modeling) both independently and alongside the legacy WIND Toolkit.},

However, CCS increases cooling water use and few studies have simulated the potential impacts of low flows on CCS power plant reliability. We present a framework to simulate the impacts of natural hydrological variability and climatic changes on water availability for portfolios of CCS capacity and cooling technologies. The methods are applied to the River Trent, the UK's largest inland cooling water source for electricity generation capacity. Under a medium emissions climate change scenario, the projected median reductions in river flow by the 2040s was 43\% for Q 99.9 very low flows and 31\% in licensable abstractions between Q 99.9 and Q 91 . With CCS developments, cooling water abstractions are projected to increase, likely exceeding available water for all users by the 2030s--2040s. Deficits are reduced when wet/dry hybrid tower cooling is used, which may increase reliability at low flows. We also explore alternative water licensing regimes, currently considered by the UK Government. Climate change and growing cooling demands, individually and jointly present risks that will be prominent by the 2030s, if unaddressed. These risks may be managed if water-efficient abstraction is prioritized when supplies are limited.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new method, based on the Smart Energy Systems concept. The aim is to increase the share of renewable energy penetration on islands. The method is applied to the island of Gran Canaria (Spain), considering the entire energy system of the island. Several smart renewable energy strategies are proposed following a cross-sectoral approach between the electricity, heating/cooling, desalination, transport and gas sectors. The different smart renewable energy strategies were applied in a series of steps, while looking for a transition from the current energy system to a nearly 100\% renewable energy system. Based on the results, the study concludes that the suggested method is applicable for increasing renewable integration on islands and can potentially be used in helping energy planners to take decisions about priorities in development of the sector to improve such integration. The results indicate that, for the case of Gran Canaria, a 75.9\% renewable energy system could be attained with technologies that can be implemented at present. Furthermore, it is shown that a nearly 100\% renewable energy system in Gran Canaria is technically feasible and could be achieved if certain technologies acquire greater maturity.}

Research in disciplines ranging from engineering to environmental policy seeks to quantify solar energy-land (SE-land) interactions to better understand the comprehensive impacts of solar energy installations on society. However, increasing evidence shows that scholars across research disciplines employ disparate metrics to quantify SE-land interactions. While solar energy deployment helps to achieve progress toward sustainable development goals (SDG 7- affordable and clean energy), the inconsistent use of metrics to describe SE-land interactions may inhibit the understanding of the total environmental and ecological impacts of solar energy installations, potentially causing barriers to achieve concurrent SDG's such as life on land (SDG 15). We systematically reviewed 608 sources on SE-land relationships globally to identify and assess the most frequent metric terms and units used in published studies. In total, we identified 51 unique metric terms and 34 different units of measure describing SE-land relationships across 18 countries of author origin. We organized these findings into three distinct metric categories: (1) capacity-based (i.e., nominal), (2) generation-based, and (3) human population-based. We used the most frequently reported terms and units in each category to inform a standardized suite of metrics, which are: land-use efficiency (W/m\textsuperscript{2}), annual and lifetime land transformation (m\textsuperscript{2}/Wh), and solar footprint (m\textsuperscript{2}/capita). This framework can facilitate greater consistency in the reporting of SE-land metrics and improved capacity for comparison and aggregations of trends, including SE-land modeling projections. Our study addresses the need for standardization while acknowledging the role for future methodological advancements.

  abstract = {Saudi Arabia can transition to a 100\% renewable energy system by 2040 including the integration of the power, desalination and non-energetic industrial gas sectors. Single-axis tracking PV and battery storage contribute the highest to the final LCOE of the system. By 2050, single-axis tracking PV accounts for 77\% of the total electricity generation. Battery storage accounts for 44\% of the total electricity demand. Desalination plants provide additional flexibility to the energy system. Through sensitivity analysis, it is found that decreasing the capex of desalination plants results in a decrease in battery storage output and ultimately the total system capex throughout the transition. However, the required SWRO capex decrease seems to be higher than possible, leading to a lower cost flexibility provided by solar PV and battery storage than possible by very low cost water storage. This is because the relatively more expensive SWRO desalination prefers baseload operation for total energy system cost reasons.}

Single-axis tracking PV and battery storage contribute the highest to the final LCOE of the system. By 2050, single-axis tracking PV accounts for 79\% of the total electricity generation. Battery storage accounts for 30\% of the total electricity demand. Battery storage and desalination plants provide additional flexibility to the energy system. Through sensitivity analysis, it is found that decreasing the capex of desalination plants results in lower full load hours (FLH) and a decrease in battery storage output. This results in lower energy system costs. However, the SWRO capex has to be reduced by 50\% to achieve a reduction of 1\% in SWRO FLH and a 2.1\% in the annualised energy system costs. This is because it is preferable to run the expensive SWRO plants in baseload operation for total energy system cost reasons. Flexibility to the energy system can be provided at a lower cost by solar PV and battery storage than by SWRO plants and water storage. Decreasing battery capex reduces the flexibility of desalination plants further, increases single-axis tracking PV capacities, decreases wind and CCGT capacities, and ultimately results in lower LCOE. These insights enable to establish the least cost pathway for Saudi Arabia to achieve net zero emissions by mid-century.}

We evaluate renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies across regional power systems in the United States in terms of carbon dioxide emissions displaced, operating costs avoided, and capacity value generated. We use data on hourly emissions and electricity generation, simulated hourly production across thousands of wind and solar sites, wholesale electricity prices, and technology costs. We find that variation in the quantity of emissions displaced by wind, solar, and efficiency resources is significant across regions but limited across resources within a region. Comparing our estimates of emissions-related benefits against technology costs, we document substantial variation in the net cost per ton of CO2 avoided. This variation has not been reflected in the prevailing policy incentives that guide investments in RE and EE resources.}

  abstract = {Abstract             Quantile mapping bias correction algorithms are commonly used to correct systematic distributional biases in precipitation outputs from climate models. Although they are effective at removing historical biases relative to observations, it has been found that quantile mapping can artificially corrupt future model-projected trends. Previous studies on the modification of precipitation trends by quantile mapping have focused on mean quantities, with less attention paid to extremes. This article investigates the extent to which quantile mapping algorithms modify global climate model (GCM) trends in mean precipitation and precipitation extremes indices. First, a bias correction algorithm, quantile delta mapping (QDM), that explicitly preserves relative changes in precipitation quantiles is presented. QDM is compared on synthetic data with detrended quantile mapping (DQM), which is designed to preserve trends in the mean, and with standard quantile mapping (QM). Next, methods are applied to phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) daily precipitation projections over Canada. Performance is assessed based on precipitation extremes indices and results from a generalized extreme value analysis applied to annual precipitation maxima. QM can inflate the magnitude of relative trends in precipitation extremes with respect to the raw GCM, often substantially, as compared to DQM and especially QDM. The degree of corruption in the GCM trends by QM is particularly large for changes in long period return values. By the 2080s, relative changes in excess of +500\% with respect to historical conditions are noted at some locations for 20-yr return values, with maximum changes by DQM and QDM nearing +240\% and +140\%, respectively, whereas raw GCM changes are never projected to exceed +120\%.},

Seven large-scale energy-economy models, namely PRIMES, TIMES-PanEu, GEM-E3, NEMESIS, WorldScan, Green-X and GAINS, which have been extensively used in EU climate and energy policy analysis are employed for the simulation and quantification of alternative EU decarbonisation pathways under technological limitations and climate policy delays. The multi-model perspective provides valuable insights for the formulation of robust policies. The model results show that the EU emissions reduction target is feasible with currently known technological options at low costs (lower than 1\% of GDP in the period 2015--2050). Models confirm the EU Roadmap priorities for 2050 with regard to accelerated energy efficiency, transport electrification and supply-side restructuring with high RES, CCS and nuclear deployment. Decarbonisation targets are found feasible even in cases with technological limitations regarding CCS and nuclear technologies and delays in transport electrification albeit with higher costs. Delaying emission reduction action until 2030 has significant adverse effects on energy system costs and stresses the system capabilities for decarbonisation.}

The paper focuses as well on emission and cost implications. The model based analysis finds that the decarbonisation of the energy system is possible with technologies known today; the power generation sector reduces emissions the most, but also demand side sectors reduce their emissions considerably. Despite considerable restructuring towards using electricity, transportation shows residual emissions by 2050 mainly due to the long-distance road freight transport and aviation. The energy system costs for decarbonisation were found to represent between 0.24 and 1.63 percentage points of cumulative GDP over the time period 2010--2050 higher than in a Reference scenario case which obtains the Climate and Energy package targets in 2020 and a long-term target of 40\% emission reductions compared to 1990. The cost range depends on the timely availability of certain decarbonisation options (e.g. CCS, electrification in transportation) and on the extent of emission reduction actions worldwide.}

This work aims to evaluate wind-PV hybrid systems technical and economically through the simulation of a hypothetical hybrid power plant in which a case study is presented. The economic viability of PV power into wind systems is assessed by the comparison of distinct scenarios, which consider different rated power for each type of source. The paper regards the context of the Brazilian energy market and is geared toward the rules, the current tariff prices, and the mean investment applied for the construction of wind and PV systems in Brazil nowadays. The results show that a pure wind energy system is economically ideal and the continuous insertion of PV power into the wind system decreases the chances of profitability. However, for certain amount of PV rated power installed in the complex, the project maintains a high probability of being successful.}

The paper proposes a technical-institutional roadmap that would allow regulators in vertically-integrated jurisdictions and system planners and operators in restructured jurisdictions to revise RA practices across a range of components. First, we compile a critical review of current RA assessment practices based on (1) interviews with RA practitioners and (2) a review of recent technical literature. We find that (i) RA may need to expand beyond capacity adequacy to ensure energy adequacy -- relevant for energy-limited resources such as storage -- and potentially some form of ancillary service adequacy (e.g. enough ramping-up and ramping-down capability in the system); (ii) chronological hourly simulations for all hours in the year are the current best practice; (iii) metrics and models used do not reflect economic criteria in system operation and loss of load; and (iv) there is a need to improve representation of weather dependencies and weather data. Second, we review planning and RA reports for several private and public entities that plan generation and/or transmission infrastructure in the continental U.S. to look for existing practices involving resilience assessments. We find no systematic treatment of the costs of extreme weather and other hazards, the benefits of resilience, and resilience metrics in planning analyses and no systematic treatment of resilience metrics, methods, and outcomes for resource adequacy purposes. Third, we create a technical framework for probabilistic RA assessment and use it to study how key choices about how to model power system operations affect the values that are obtained for RA metrics. We find that (i) non-economic dispatch schemes that ignore economic objectives can lead to accurate RA assessments when coordinated with detailed operational strategies; (ii) multi-year data is critical to capture a wide variety of system conditions; (iii) not incorporating transmission limits into RA assessment could lead to substantial underestimation of traditional ``expected value'' RA metrics; and (iv) new RA metrics that capture event-specific shortfall characteristics should be used as supplements to traditional metrics. Finally, we examine RA assessments and use this information to propose a guide of evolving industry standards for resource adequacy assessments in resource planning and transmission planning. We report minimum, best, and frontier practices for temporal resolution of assessments, metrics and targets, weather data, load forecasting, characterization of variable renewable resources, characterization of transmission and market transactions, RA modeling and integration with planning processes, and capacity accreditation.},

  abstract = {Integrated resource planning (IRP) is a process used by many vertically-integrated U.S. electric utilities to determine least-cost/risk supply and demand-side resources that meet government policy objectives and future obligations to customers and, in many cases, shareholders. Forecasts of energy and peak demand are a critical component of the IRP process. There have been few, if any, quantitative studies of IRP long-run (planning horizons of two decades) load forecast performance and its relationship to resource planning and actual procurement decisions. In this paper, we evaluate load forecasting methods, assumptions, and outcomes for 12 Western U.S. utilities by examining and comparing plans filed in the early 2000s against recent plans, up to year 2014. We find a convergence in the methods and data sources used. We also find that forecasts in more recent IRPs generally took account of new information, but that there continued to be a systematic over-estimation of load growth rates during the period studied. We compare planned and procured resource expansion against customer load and year-to-year load growth rates, but do not find a direct relationship. Load sensitivities performed in resource plans do not appear to be related to later procurement strategies even in the presence of large forecast errors. These findings suggest that resource procurement decisions may be driven by other factors than customer load growth. Our results have important implications for the integrated resource planning process, namely that load forecast accuracy may not be as important for resource procurement as is generally believed, that load forecast sensitivities could be used to improve the procurement process, and that management of load uncertainty should be prioritized over more complex forecasting techniques.},

Price-based demand response (DR) is an underutilized resource that could substantially contribute to load flexibility. We find that evaluation of price-based DR as a solution to meet identified electricity system needs is uncommon at both planning processes. Where price-based DR is considered as a solution, methodologies are often deficient in the characterization and treatment of this resource. Based on our analysis of utility filings and state requirements, this brief provides recommendations for improving consideration of price-based DR in the context of long-term planning for bulk power and distribution systems.},

Nevertheless, these benefits are strongly related to the sizing and the energy management strategy (EMS) of the microgrid. In this regard, the sizing and the EMS acquire high importance for the planning of stand-alone microgrids. The present paper aims to design a sizing methodology that has a nested simulation model for power and energy balances. The sizing uses a heuristic approximation of the gradient descent method for discrete functions. The simulation model can evaluate the operation of the microgrid, even with EMSs using optimal criteria. A study case evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to a traditional heuristic technique as Particle Swarm Optimization and an exhaustive search, which prove the feasibility of the algorithm to be used in stand-alone microgrid planning.},

While oil and gas should become less of a destabilizing factor in U.S.--China relations, more of the global tension associated with it will shift to China and its relations with other states. However, even with less U.S.--China competition for oil and gas, each side may still seek to engage in actions incompatible with the other's perceived national interest. If the United States were to try to aggressively exploit its new position or if China were to pursue a second, more intense round of its ``going out'' strategy, the consequences for both sides could be very negative. Accordingly, it would be preferable if each side worked to find ways to turn what often has been understood as a zero-sum competition into a positive-sum opportunity for both. Despite a major obstacle to such cooperation, several potential areas for mutually beneficial engagement exist and are outlined in this article.}

Given the uncertain impact of such exports, it is not surprising that the U.S. administration has equivocated on various permitting decisions. However, in December 2012 or shortly thereafter, the Department of Energy is expected to release a study analyzing and evaluating many of the trade-offs involved in such exports. Unless this report conclusively demonstrates that (1) LNG exports would cause significant damage to U.S. residential and industrial consumers and (2) that higher domestic natural gas prices would not be more than compensated for through the gains of international trade, the administration should permit the construction of at least three or four more LNG export terminals. Such a permitting approach would not greatly change the existing domestic natural gas market, and it would allow the government to observe how the markets and their participants react to the change. Besides the probable benefits accruing to the United States through increased trade, such a change would bring a number of other foreign policy benefits.}

  abstract = {A bankable solar radiation database is required for the financial viability of solar energy project. Accurate estimation of solar energy resources in a country is very important for proper siting, sizing and life cycle cost analysis of solar energy systems. During the last decade an important progress has been made to develop multiple solar irradiance database (Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) and Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)), using satellite of different resolution and sophisticated models. This paper assesses the performance of High-resolution solar irradiance derived with dynamical downscaling Numerical Weather Prediction model with, GIS topographical solar radiation model, satellite data and ground measurements, for the production of bankable solar radiation datasets. For this investigation, NWP model namely Consortium for Small-scale Modeling (COSMO) is used for the dynamical downscaling of solar radiation. The obtained results increase confidence in solar radiation data base obtained from dynamical downscaled NWP model. The mean bias of dynamical downscaled NWP model is small, on the order of a few percents for GHI, and it could be ranked as a bankable datasets. Fortunately, these data are usually archived in the meteorological department and gives a good idea of the hourly, monthly, and annual incident energy. Such short time-interval data are valuable in designing and operating the solar energy facility. The advantage of the NWP model is that it can be used for solar radiation forecast since it can estimate the weather condition within the next 72--120 hours. This gives a reasonable estimation of the solar radiation that in turns can be used to forecast the electric power generation by the solar power plant.}

Different from traditional approaches which approximate ELCC of renewable resources using system peak loads, nonsequential block load duration curves, or rolling-based sequential methods, the stochastic long-term hourly based SCUC could accurately examine the impacts of short-term variability and uncertainty of renewable resources as well as chronological operation details of generators on hourly supplydemand imbalance and power system reliability in a long-term horizon. Uncertainties of hourly wind, solar, and load in a 1-year horizon are simulated via the scenario tree using the Monte Carlo method, and Approximate Dynamic Programming is adopted for effectively solving the stochastic long-term hourly based SCUC model. Variability correlations between wind speed and solar radiation are considered within the scenario sampling procedure. Moreover, parallel computing is designed with the pipeline structure for accelerating the computational performance of Approximate Dynamic Programming. Numerical case studies on the modified IEEE 118-bus system illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic long-term hourly based SCUC model and the Approximate Dynamic Programming solution approach for evaluating ELCC of renewable resources. This would help independent system operators (ISO) designs effective long-term planning strategies for operating power systems efficiently and reliably.}

For managing the power, a pattern of daily operation considering the load characteristic of the homeowner, the generation characteristic of the PV power, and the power-leveling demand of the electric utility is prescribed. The system looks up the pattern to select the operation mode, so that powers from the PV array, the batteries and the utility are utilized in a cost-effective manner. As for the control of the system, a novel control technique for the maximum power-point tracking (MPPT) of the PV array is proposed, in which the state-averaged model of the DC-DC power converter, including the dynamic model of the PV array, is derived. Accordingly, a high-performance discrete MPPT controller that tracks the maximum power point with zero-slope regulation and current-mode control is presented. With proposed arrangements on the control of the BESS and the current-to-power scaling factor setting, the DC-DC power converter is capable of combining with the BESS for performing the functions of power conditioning and active power filtering. An experimental 600 W system is implemented, and some simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.}

  abstract = {The Baltic Sea Region could become the first area of Europe to reach a 100\% renewable energy (RE) power sector. Simulations of the system transition from 2015 to 2050 were performed using an hourly resolved model that defines the roles of storage technologies in a least cost system configuration. Investigated technologies are batteries, pumped hydro storage, adiabatic compressed air energy storage, thermal energy storage, and power-to-gas. Modelling proceeds in five-year time steps, and considers current energy system assets and projected demands to determine the optimal technology mix needed to achieve 100\% RE electricity by 2050. This optimization is carried out under the assumed cost and status of all technologies involved. Results indicate the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) falls from 60 {\texteuro}/MWhe to 45 {\texteuro}/MWhe over time through adoption of low cost RE power generation and from inter-regional grid interconnection. Additionally, power system flexibility and stability are provided by ample resources of storable bioenergy, hydropower, inter-regional power transmission, and increasing shares of energy storage, together with expected price decreases in storage technologies. Total storage requirements include 0-238 GWhe of batteries, 19 GWhe of pumped hydro storage, and 0-16,652 GWhgas of gas storage. The cost share of storage in total LCOE increases from under 1 {\texteuro}/MWh to up to 10 {\texteuro}/MWh over time. Outputs of power-to-gas begin in 2040 when RE generation approaches a share of 100\% in the power system, and total no more than 2 GWhgas due to the relatively large roles of bioenergy and hydropower in the system, which preclude the need for high amounts of additional seasonal storage. A 100\% RE system can be an economical and efficient solution for the Baltic Sea Region, one that is also compatible with climate change mitigation targets set out at COP21. Concurrently, effective policy and planning is needed to facilitate such a transition.}

Hourly data was analysed to determine the roles of various energy storage solutions, notably V2G connections that extended into electric boat batteries. Two weeks of interest (max/min RE) generation were studied in detail to determine the roles of energy storage solutions. Participation in V2G connections facilitated high shares of variable RE on a daily and weekly basis. In a Sustainable Mobility scenario, high participation in V2G (2750 MWhe) resulted in less gas storage (1200 MWhth), electrolyser capacity (6.1 MWe), methanation capacity (3.9 MWhgas), and offshore wind power capacity (55 MWe) than other scenarios that featured lower V2G participation. Consequently, total annualised costs were lower (225 M\&euro;/a). The influence of V2G connections on seasonal storage is an interesting result for a relatively cold, northern geographic area. A key point is that stored electricity need not only be considered as storage for future use by the grid, but V2G batteries can provide a buffer between generation of intermittent RE and its end-use. Direct consumption of intermittent RE further reduces the need for storage and generation capacities.},

  abstract = {There are several barriers to achieving an energy system based entirely on renewable energy (RE) in Finland, not the least of which is doubt that high capacities of solar photovoltaics (PV) can be feasible due to long, cold and dark Finnish winters. Technologically, several energy storage options can facilitate high penetrations of solar PV and other variable forms of RE. These options include electric and thermal storage systems in addition to a robust role of Power-to-Gas technology. In an EnergyPLAN simulation of the Finnish energy system for 2050, approximately 45\% of electricity produced from solar PV was used directly over the course of the year, which shows the relevance of storage. In terms of public policy, several mechanisms are available to promote various forms of RE. However, many of these are contested in Finland by actors with vested interests in maintaining the status quo rather than by those without confidence in RE conversion or storage technologies. These vested interests must be overcome before a zero fossil carbon future can begin. The results of this study provides insights into how higher capacities of solar PV can be effectively promoted and managed at high latitudes, both north and south.},

Simulations using an hourly resolved model define the roles of storage technologies in a least cost system configuration. Results indicate that the levelised cost of electricity will fall from a current level of 82 {\texteuro}/MWhe to 60 {\texteuro}/MWhe in 2050 through the adoption of low cost RE power generation and improvements in efficiency. If the capacity in 2050 would have been invested for the cost assumptions of 2050, the cost would be 54 {\texteuro}/MWhe, which can be expected for the time beyond 2050. In addition, flexibility of and stability in the power system are provided by increasing shares of energy storage solutions over time, in parallel with expected price decreases in these technologies. Total storage requirements include 0-139 GWhe of batteries, 9 GWhe of pumped hydro storage, and 0-18,840 GWhgas of gas storage for the time period. Outputs of power-to-gas begin in 2035 when renewable energy production reaches a share of 86\% in the power system, increasing to a total of 13 TWhgas in 2050. A 100\% RE system can be a more economical and efficient solution for Ukraine, one that is also compatible with climate change mitigation targets set out at COP21. Achieving a sustainable energy system can aid in achieving other political, economic and social goals for Ukraine, but this will require overcoming several barriers through proper planning and supportive policies.}

  abstract = {A transition towards a 100\% renewable energy (RE) power sector by 2050 is investigated for Europe. Simulations using an hourly resolved model define the roles of storage technologies in a least cost system configuration. The investigated technologies are batteries, pumped hydro storage, adiabatic compressed air energy storage, thermal energy storage, and power-to-gas technology. Modelling proceeds from 2015 to 2050 in five-year time steps, and considers current power plant capacities, their corresponding lifetimes, and current and projected electricity demand to determine an optimal mix of plants needed to achieve a 100\% RE power system by 2050. This optimization is carried out with regards to the assumed costs and technological status of all technologies involved. The total power capacity required by 2050, shares of resources, and storage technologies are defined. Results indicate that the levelised cost of electricity falls from a current level of 69 {\texteuro}/MWhe to 51 {\texteuro}/MWhe in 2050 through the adoption of low cost RE power generation, improvements in efficiency, and expanded power interconnections. Additionally, flexibility of and stability in the power system are provided by increasing shares of energy storage solutions over time, in parallel with expected price decreases in these technologies. Total storage requirements include up to 3320 GWhe of batteries, 396 GWhe of pumped hydro storage, and 218,042 GWhgas of gas storage (8\% for synthetic natural gas and 92\% for biomethane) for the time period depending on the scenario. The cost share of levelised cost of storage in the total levelised cost of electricity increases from less than 2 {\texteuro}/MWh (2\% of total) to 16 {\texteuro}/MWh (28\% of total) over the same time. Outputs of power-to-gas begin in 2020 when renewable energy generation reaches 50\% in the power system, increasing to a total of 44 TWhgas in 2050. A 100\% RE system can be a more economical and efficient solution for Europe, one that is also compatible with climate change mitigation targets set out in the Paris Agreement.}

Several scenarios were constructed for the future energy system based on various combinations of domestic production of wind and solar photovoltaic power, expanded domestic energy storage solutions, electrified transport, and strategic energy carrier trade. Hourly analysis of scenarios using the EnergyPLAN tool shows that annualised costs of operating a future sustainable energy system for the year 2030 range between 225 and 247M{\texteuro}/a compared to 229M{\texteuro}/a for the business as usual case. However, this result is highly dependent on how vehicle and battery costs are accounted. A scenario featuring a highly electrified transport sector, including a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic forms of mobility, was among the most cost competitive solutions due to high levels of flexibility and electric storage harnessed in the energy system. In this scenario cost reductions were achieved as high capacities of electric vehicle battery storage resulted in less need for seasonal storage and synthetic fuel production in the form of Power-to-Gas technologies and offshore wind power capacity. Results also indicate that 100\% renewable energy-based domestic energy production can be achieved in {\AA}land, with or without reliance on imported energy carriers, such as sustainable biofuels or electricity. A demonstration of a highly electrified transport sector may also offer {\AA}land society several benefits outside of the boundaries of the energy system. New job creation related to renewable energy production on {\AA}land could total between at least 3100 and 3900 job-years during manufacturing, construction and installation, and between 45 and 59more permanent jobs related to operations and maintenance, depending on the scenario.}

  abstract = {An energy system based entirely on renewable energy (RE) is possible for Finland in 2050 based on the assumptions in this study. High shares of solar PV (photovoltaics) were deemed to be feasible at extreme northern latitudes when supported by flexibility harnessed from other aspects of the energy system, suggesting that high variations in solar irradiation throughout the year may not be a barrier to the implementation of solar PV closer to the poles. A 100\% RE system corresponds to a highly competitive cost solution for Finland, as total system costs decrease through interaction between the power, heating/cooling and mobility sectors. We incorporate these sectors on an hourly resolution using historical data and the EnergyPLAN modelling tool. In addition, we offer full transparency of all assumptions regarding the Finnish energy system. In 2050, a 100\% renewable energy scenario has the lowest overall annual cost, at 24.1b{\texteuro}/a. This is followed by several scenarios that feature increasing levels of nuclear power, which range in annual costs to 26.4b{\texteuro}/a. Scenarios were also modelled with varying levels of forest-based biomass. Results suggest that annual costs do not increase dramatically with reduced levels of forest-based biomass fuel use. At the same time, it must be kept in mind that assigning costs to the future is inherently uncertain. How future societies assign risk to technologies or place value on emissions can make the scenarios under investigation more or less attractive. The 100\% RE scenarios under investigation were seen as less exposed to such uncertainty.}

  abstract = {Solar photovoltaics (PV) are on the rise even in areas of low solar insolation. However, in developing countries with limited capital, land scarcity, or with geographically isolated agrarian communities, large solar infrastructures are often impractical. In these cases, implementation of low-density PV over existing crops may be required to integrate renewable energy services into rural communities. Here, using Indonesia as a model system, we investigated the land use, energy, greenhouse gas emissions, economic feasibility, and the environmental co-benefits associated with off-grid solar PV when combined with high value crop cultivation. The life cycle analyses indicate that small-scale dual land-use systems are economically viable in certain configurations and have the potential to provide several co-benefits including rural electrification, retrofitting diesel electricity generation, and electricity for processing agricultural products locally. A hypothetical full-density off-grid solar PV for a model village in Indonesia shows that electricity output (1907.5~GJ~yr-1) is much higher than the total residential consumption (678~GJ~yr-1), highlighting the opportunity to downscale the PV infrastructure by half to lower capital cost, to co-locate crops, and to support secondary income generating activities. Economic analysis shows that the 30-year net present cost of electricity from the half-density co-located PV system (12,257 million IDR) is significantly lower than that of the flat cost of diesel required to generate equivalent electricity (14,702 million IDR). Our analysis provides insights for smarter energy planning by optimizing the efficiency of land use and limiting conversion of agricultural and forested areas for energy production.}

The analysis made use of the conventional economic dispatching philosophy used in planning the day-to-day operation of utility systems. According to this approach, the battery storage element is charged when the utility system cost of generating power is lowest and discharged when it is highest. As a result, much of the energy placed in storage is from the utility network and only a portion is supplied by the photovoltaic element of the plant. Also, if the cost of generation dictates, the energy in storage may be dispatched at the same time as the photovoltaic plant. The rationale for this optimum operating scheme is discussed.}

In contrast, Jacobson et al. [Jacobson MZ, Delucchi MA, Cameron MA, Frew BA (2015) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112(49):15060--15065] argue that it is feasible to provide ``low-cost solutions to the grid reliability problem with 100\% penetration of WWS [wind, water and solar power] across all energy sectors in the continental United States between 2050 and 2055'', with only electricity and hydrogen as energy carriers. In this paper, we evaluate that study and find significant shortcomings in the analysis. In particular, we point out that this work used invalid modeling tools, contained modeling errors, and made implausible and inadequately supported assumptions. Policy makers should treat with caution any visions of a rapid, reliable, and low-cost transition to entire energy systems that relies almost exclusively on wind, solar, and hydroelectric power.},

The book's purpose is to help architects, mechanical \& environmental engineers and energy \& facility managers to understand and apply the emerging computer methods for options appraisal at the individual building, estate, city, region and national levels. This is achieved by interspersing theoretical derivations relating to simulation within an evolving description of the built environment as a complex system.

Changes in the future electricity generation mix in the United States will have important implications for water use, particularly given the changing water availability arising from competing demands and climate change and variability.

This paper uses the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) to model a range of low-carbon electricity futures nationally that are used to calculate changes in national water use (a sample result, on water consumption, is included here). The model also produces detailed sub-regional electricity results through 2050 that can be linked with basin-level water modeling.

Despite the differences, these studies share some common conclusions, one of which is that renewable energy resources can play a large role in future power systems.

  abstract = {The longstanding method for reporting greenhouse gas emissions---carbon dioxide equivalence (CO               2               e)---systematically underestimates methane-dominated economic sectors' contributions to warming in the coming decades. This is because it only calculates the warming impact of a pulse of emissions over a 100-year period. For short-lived climate forcers that mostly influence the climate for a decade or two, like methane, this method masks their near-term potency. Assessing the impacts of future greenhouse gas emissions using a simple climate model reveals that midcentury warming contributions of sectors dominated by methane---agriculture, fossil fuel production and distribution, and waste---are two times higher than estimated using CO               2               e. The CO               2               e method underemphasizes the importance of reducing emissions from these sectors, and risks misaligning emissions targets with desired temperature outcomes. It is essential to supplement CO               2               e-derived insights with approaches that convey climate impacts of ongoing emissions over multiple timescales, and to never rely exclusively on CO               2               e.},

  abstract = {Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH) is currently the largest source of utility-scale electricity storage in the U.S. and worldwide. As the accelerating deployment of variable renewable technologies creates opportunity and value for energy storage, it has become increasingly important to characterize PSH costs to understand how it competes. Site-specific considerations and limited cost data in the public domain make it difficult to estimate capital costs for potential new PSH sites. This report documents a spreadsheet-based tool that addresses this challenge and creates a component-level bottom-up cost model for PSH that can be made publicly available for widespread use. It uses detailed site-level physical characteristics and design specifications to calculate key performance and cost parameters for individual components and the project as a whole. The model was developed in consultation with HDR, Inc. and Small Hydro Consulting to ensure it aligns with industry expectations. It enables PSH cost exploration across a wide range of system assumptions and could be customized or extended for the needs of a variety of users.},

  abstract = {The power sector is currently undergoing significant changes, driven by a combination of factors, including decarbonization and technology innovation. This study aims to assess implications of these drivers on U.S. power sector technology futures and the associated water and environmental implications for cooling thermoelectric power plants. Specifically, we evaluate four decarbonization scenarios for the contiguous United States that vary in assumptions concerning demand growth and technology costs, with technology costs driving alternative outcomes that prioritize either technologies that require low amounts of water (such as wind, solar, and battery) or high amounts of water (such as nuclear and carbon capture and storage). These scenarios are executed in a power sector capacity expansion model and compared to two reference scenarios that assume status quo with policy and cost drivers. Our analysis indicates that future U.S. thermoelectric water withdrawals could decrease by 25-60\%, but water consumption could more than triple in some scenarios. These changes are driven by a combination of retirement of some power facilities, shifts in cooling technologies, and new technology deployment. The water use patterns vary across the United States, with the eastern regions demonstrating a lot more variability in water consumption across scenarios than western regions. However, local concerns can influence these possible investments, since increased water consumption can exacerbate water scarcity, leading to conflicts among competing users and affecting regional social, environmental, and economic dynamics. Future work should consider possible costs associated with alternate water sources, as well as improve the representation of water constraints within simulations. Inclusion of extreme events and alternate modeling platforms (e.g., production cost modeling and resource adequacy) may also be warranted to further stress test the robustness of these possible technology futures. Such assessments will be critical for ensuring decarbonization and other infrastructure-oriented investments lead to a reliable and resilient power grid.},

  abstract = {The U.S. electric sector is experiencing rapid increases in renewable generation with an expectation of continued growth. We examine the impacts of increased wind electricity on the U.S. economy using a hybrid model that links a detailed electric sector model (the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Regional Energy Deployment System [ReEDS]) with a computable general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy (the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's U.S. Regional Energy Policy [USREP] model). Increasing wind capacity displaces fossil fuels for electricity generation, which depresses fossil fuel prices and reduces economy-wide CO2 emissions. Competitive wind deployment in the reference scenario achieves these outcomes with lower electricity prices than a scenario with wind capacity fixed at 2016 levels. Lower fossil fuel and electricity prices benefit low-income households, but the dominant economic impacts are driven by increased electric sector investment and capital returns, which primarily benefit those with higher incomes. Overall, cost-competitive wind provides benefits to the U.S. economy that are initially low but rise beyond 2030 to achieve cumulative welfare and GDP improvements of \$110 and \$111 billion through 2050. Prescribing additional wind deployment (meeting 35\% of demand by 2050) increases post-2030 electricity prices but not more so than keeping wind capacity fixed at 2016 levels. The negative effect of higher prices on welfare, however, is outweighed by higher returns from the additional wind investment. While these changes favor higher income classes, we find economy-wide benefits through 2040. These benefits diminish by 2050, but the cumulative additional gains through 2050, beyond the reference case, are \$192 billion in welfare and \$150 billion in GDP.}

  abstract = {In the context of recent dramatic solar energy cost reductions, the U.S. Department of Energy set new levelized cost of energy goals for photovoltaics (PV) to achieve by 2030 to enable significantly greater PV adoption: \$0.03/kWh for utility-scale, \$0.04/kWh for commercial, and \$0.05/kWh for residential PV systems. We analyze the potential impacts of achieving these ``SunShot 2030'' cost targets for the contiguous United States using the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) and Distributed Generation (dGen) capacity expansion models. We consider the impacts under a wide range of future conditions. We find that PV could provide 13\%--18\% of U.S. electricity demand in 2030 and 28\%--64\% of demand if the SunShot 2030 goals are achieved, with PV deployment increasing in every state. The availability of low-cost storage has the largest impact on projected deployment, followed by natural gas prices and electricity demand. For comparison, PV deployed under a business-as-usual scenario could provide only 5\% of generation in 2030 and 17\% in 2050. We find that the high levels of PV deployment explored here lead to lower electricity prices and system costs, lower carbon dioxide emissions, lower water consumption, increased renewable energy curtailment, and increased storage deployment compared with the business-as-usual scenario.}

This growth has been driven by several factors, including technology cost reductions and policy support. The share of renewable generation is projected to increase over time. Reference case scenarios from four different organizations show least-cost U.S. electricity buildouts with renewable energy generation fractions of 31--36 \% by 2030 and 40--65 \% by 2050. Using a capacity expansion modeling tool, we investigate how changing the amount of renewable energy from the least-cost solution impacts the cost of building and operating the electricity system. The relationship between system cost and renewable energy generation fraction is non-linear. Small deviations near the least-cost solution have minimal cost impacts (changing the renewable energy penetration by +/- 5\% results in system cost changes of less than 1\%), while similar deviations that are farther from the least-cost solution can result in large cost changes. Increased levels of RE lead to lower absolute emissions, and we evaluate the trade-offs between emissions savings and system costs for higher and lower levels of RE penetration.}

  abstract = {Distribution-sited solar photovoltaics (PV) economics (including rooftop PV) have improved significantly during the past several years, spurring increased installations, with over 2.2 GW installed in 2014 in the United States. This increased deployment is largely projected to continue and has prompted additional interest in the interactions of rooftop PV deployment with the greater electricity system. In this paper we focus on one piece of this interface, namely the interaction between rooftop PV deployment and the evolution of the bulk power system. We develop a novel linkage between NREL's bulk power capacity expansion model (the Renewable Energy Deployment System [ReEDS] model) and NREL's rooftop PV adoption model (the dSolar model). We use these linked models to gain insights into the interactions of rooftop PV deployment with the bulk power system. We explore two sets of scenarios. In the first set we examine how different levels of rooftop PV deployment impact the generation mix on the bulk power system. In the second set we examine how the generation mix of the bulk power system impacts the deployment of rooftop PV by applying grid-wide curtailment rates to rooftop PV systems. In these sets of scenarios, we find that rooftop PV generation and utility PV generation have a nearly 1:1 substitution effect. We also find that curtailment rate feedback can have dramatic impacts on rooftop PV adoption, though the range of impacts is strongly dependent on the generation mix of the bulk power system and the amount of total PV generation in the system. For example, scenarios with more natural gas generation tended to have lower curtailment rates and thus more rooftop PV deployment.}

  abstract = {This study examines the potential change in primary emissions and energy use from replacing the current U.S. fleet of fossil-fuel on-road vehicles (FFOV) with hybrid electric fossil fuel vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCV). Emissions and energy usage are analyzed for three different HFCV scenarios, with hydrogen produced from: (1) steam reforming of natural gas, (2) electrolysis powered by wind energy, and (3) coal gasification. With the U.S. EPA's National Emission Inventory as the baseline, other emission inventories are created using a life cycle assessment (LCA) of alternative fuel supply chains. For a range of reasonable HFCV efficiencies and methods of producing hydrogen, we find that the replacement of FFOV with HFCV significantly reduces emission associated with air pollution, compared even with a switch to hybrids. All HFCV scenarios decrease net air pollution emission, including nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter, ammonia, and carbon monoxide. These reductions are achieved with hydrogen production from either a fossil fuel source such as natural gas or a renewable source such as wind. Furthermore, replacing FFOV with hybrids or HFCV with hydrogen derived from natural gas, wind or coal may reduce the global warming impact of greenhouse gases and particles (measured in carbon dioxide equivalent emission) by 6, 14, 23, and 1\%, respectively. Finally, even if HFCV are fueled by a fossil fuel such as natural gas, if no carbon is sequestered during hydrogen production, and 1\% of methane in the feedstock gas is leaked to the environment, natural gas HFCV still may achieve a significant reduction in greenhouse gas and air pollution emission over FFOV.}

These electricity prices are employed directly in the objective function of the EMPC problem. This paper considers how electricity prices can be designed in order to achieve a specific objective, which in this case is minimizing peak electricity demand. A primal-dual formulation of the EMPC problem is presented that is used to determine optimal prices that minimize peak demand. The method is demonstrated on a simulated community of 900 residential homes to create a pricing structure that minimizes the peak demand of the community of homes. The pricing structure shows that homes should be given a 1-h peak demand duration, and that the peak prices given to the homes should be spread unevenly across 6 h of the afternoon.}

The paper also discusses how applications of thermal storage can benefit the chemical industry. Optimization of the design and control of thermal storage systems improves plant performance and improves the management of transient energy loads in a variety of applications. In order to maximize the benefits of thermal storage, it is necessary to include advanced multivariate constrained controls, such as model predictive control. Thermal storage also increases system flexibility, allowing the incorporation of intermittent renewable energy sources. The flexibility of thermal storage will play an increasingly important role as utilities implement smart grid technology with time-of-use electricity pricing. Lastly, thermal energy storage improves system economics by reducing required equipment sizes, improving efficiency, and reducing equipment wear.}

Incremental abatement costs from 99\% to 100\% RE reach 930/ton, driven primarily by the need for firm RE capacity. In addition to the base conditions, we also examined 22 alternative conditions for a buildout of up to 100\%. These sensitivities capture different technology trajectories, compliance requirements, requirement timing, electrification, and transmission availability. Nonlinear marginal costs for the last few percent approaching 100\% RE were found for all sensitivities, which might motivate alternative nonelectric-sector abatement opportunities.}

Low, mid, and high cost trajectories are created for the overnight capital costs and the operating and maintenance costs. We then demonstrate the impact of these cost projections in the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) capacity expansion model. We find that under reference scenario conditions, lower battery costs can lead to increased penetration of variable renewable energy, with solar photovoltaics (PV) seeing the largest increase. We also find that additional storage can reduce renewable energy curtailment, although that comes at the expense of additional storage losses.}

The RWGTM passes electricity-sector natural gas prices to the ReEDS model, while the ReEDS model returns electricity-sector natural gas demand to the RWGTM. The two models successfully converge to a solution under reference scenario conditions. We present electricity-sector and natural gas sector evolution using the integrated models for this reference scenario. This paper demonstrates that the integrated models produced similar national-level results as when running in a stand-alone form, but that regional and state-level results can vary considerably. As we highlight, these regional differences have potentially significant implications for electric sector planners especially in the wake of substantive policy changes for the sector (e.g., the Clean Power Plan).}

The principal new components added to the physical climate model are the terrestrial and ocean ecosystems and gas-phase tropospheric chemistry, along with their coupled interactions.  The individual Earth system components are described briefly and the relevant interactions between the components are explained. Because the multiple interactions could lead to unstable feedbacks, we go through a careful process of model spin up to ensure that all components are stable and the interactions balanced. This spun-up configuration is evaluated against observed data for the Earth system components and is generally found to perform very satisfactorily. The reason for the evaluation phase is that the model is to be used for the core climate simulations carried out by the Met Office Hadley Centre for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), so it is essential that addition of the extra complexity does not detract substantially from its climate performance. Localised changes in some specific meteorological variables can be identified, but the impacts on the overall simulation of present day climate are slight.  This model is proving valuable both for climate predictions, and for investigating the strengths of biogeochemical feedbacks.}

The aim of this paper is to aid this process by comparing 7 different methods for producing transport fuels in terms of the resources required, the conversion processes used, the fuel obtained, and the transport demand met. The results indicate that electricity should be prioritised as a transport fuel in the future since it is the most efficient and cheapest pathway. However, since electricity is not suitable for all modes of transport, some form of energy dense fuel is also necessary. The results in this paper suggest that this fuel will be produced by hydrogenating either biomass or carbon dioxide, depending on the residual biomass available. Biomass gasification, steam electrolysis, and carbon capture are key technologies in the future for these fuels. Based on the assumptions in this study, some of the renewable fuels proposed here would be cheaper than oil in the year 2050. However, this is based on fuel production costs only and does do not consider other key costs, such as the infrastructure costs, which will be considered in the future research.}

As energy prices increase and the effects of global warming worsen, it is essential that Ireland begins to utilise its renewable resources more effectively. Therefore, this study presents the first step towards a 100\% renewable energy-system for Ireland. The energy-system analysis tool used was EnergyPLAN, as it accounts for all sectors of the energy-system that need to be considered when integrating large penetrations of renewable energy: the electricity, heat, and transport sectors. Initially, a reference model of the existing Irish energy-system was constructed, and subsequently three different 100\% renewable energy-systems were created with each focusing on a different resource: biomass, hydrogen, and electricity. These energy-systems were compared so that the benefits from each could be used to create an `optimum' scenario called combination. Although the results illustrate a potential 100\% renewable energy-system for Ireland, they have been obtained based on numerous assumptions. Therefore, these will need to be improved in the future before a serious roadmap can be defined for Ireland's renewable energy transition.}

The typical applications for the 37 tools reviewed (from analysing single-building systems to national energy-systems), combined with numerous other factors such as the energy-sectors considered, technologies accounted for, time parameters used, tool availability, and previous studies, will alter the perception of the `ideal' energy tool.

The transition from a business-as-usual situation in 2050, to a 100\% renewable energy Europe is analysed in a series of steps. Each step reflects one major technological change. For each step, the impact is presented in terms of energy (primary energy supply), environment (carbon dioxide emissions), and economy (total annual socio-economic cost). The steps are ordered in terms of their scientific and political certainty as follows: decommissioning nuclear power, implementing a large amount of heat savings, converting the private car fleet to electricity, providing heat in rural areas with heat pumps, providing heat in urban areas with district heating, converting fuel in heavy-duty vehicles to a renewable electrofuel, and replacing natural gas with methane. The results indicate that by using the Smart Energy System approach, a 100\% renewable energy system in Europe is technically possible without consuming an unsustainable amount of bioenergy. This is due to the additional flexibility that is created by connecting the electricity, heating, cooling, and transport sectors together, which enables an intermittent renewable penetration of over 80\% in the electricity sector. The cost of the Smart Energy Europe scenario is approximately 10--15\% higher than a business-as-usual scenario, but since the final scenario is based on local investments instead of imported fuels, it will create approximately 10 million additional direct jobs within the EU.}

  abstract = {This study quantifies the effects of aggregating electric load over various combinations (Aggregation Groupings) of the 10 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regions in the contiguous U.S. Generator capacity capital cost savings, load energy shift operating cost savings, reserve requirement cost savings, and transmission costs due to aggregation were calculated for each Aggregation Grouping. Eight scenarios of Aggregation Groupings over the U.S. were formed to estimate overall system cost. Transmission costs outweighed cost savings due to aggregation for all scenarios and nearly all Aggregation Groupings. East--west transmission layouts had the highest overall cost, and interconnecting ERCOT to adjacent FERC Regions resulted in increased costs, both due to limited existing transmission capacity. This study found little economic benefit of aggregating electric load alone (e.g., without aggregating renewable generators simultaneously), except in the West and Northwest U.S. If aggregation of load alone is desired, small, regional consolidations yield the lowest overall cost. This study neither examines nor precludes benefits of interconnecting geographically-dispersed renewable generators with load. It also does not consider effects from sub-hourly load variability, fuel diversity and price uncertainty, energy price differences due to congestion, or uncertainty due to forecasting errors; thus, results are valid only for the assumptions made.},

This paper investigates the prospects for realization of the 100\% renewable energy system in Macedonia by making use of the EnergyPLAN model. Analysis was conducted for two renewable scenarios designed for the years 2030 and 2050. First scenario, the 50\% renewable energy system, has been created for the year 2030 and represents the first step towards the 100\% renewable energy future of Macedonia. The second scenario has been designed for the 100\% renewable energy system based only on the renewable energy sources (RES) in the year 2050. Special attention in the design of these systems has been given to intermittent RES and to storage technologies. The analysis reveals that at the moment the 50\% renewable energy system seems much more likely than the 100\% renewable energy system, but with additional energy efficiency measures, which will lead to a decrease of consumption and with installation of new generation capacities this goal can be easily achieved.}

  abstract = {Solar and wind energy are expected to play a key role in creating a climate-neutral Europe by 2050 and decarbonizing energy production in general, albeit requiring significant deployment. This presupposes that the population accepts such energy sources, thus necessitates understanding how people perceive energy systems. Unlike the abundant literature about wind energy, social acceptance of solar energy has received less attention, especially concerning large solar installations. Opinion polls indicate that solar energy enjoys a high level of socio-political acceptance and is preferred to other renewables, although it is unclear whether this acceptance persists as the technology is deployed on a large scale. This paper helps close this gap by describing the results of a representative survey (n~=~601) conducted using a between-subject design to examine how attitudes of the public towards solar energy vary based on the size of installations, how the latter compare to attitudes towards wind energy, and what the role of affect is in the former. Results reveal that the stronger preference for solar power decreases to a similar level as that for wind energy when comparing installation of similar sizes, highlighting that solar energy installations may not easily be scaled up. The study also shows that affect plays an important role in forming people's attitudes towards wind and solar, especially concerning large-scale installations. This underlines the need for policymakers and project developers, who aim to deploy renewables on a large scale, to attend to the affective component of decision-making.}

We use county level data from 2005 to 2013 for 13 states in the Northeast United States including the District of Columbia. In estimating the relationship between incentives and solar PV capacity, we control for insolation, market factors, and demographic characteristics. We also account for indicators of pro-environmental attitudes and preferences for solar technology. Results indicate that factors affecting financial returns from a solar PV installation like electricity price and insolation are highly significant. Among policy variables, rebates, solar renewable energy credit price, and sales tax waivers are significant, along with years of Renewable Portfolio Standard implementation. Indicators of environmental preferences and familiarity with solar technology are not as important, which is in contrast with findings in the residential solar market. This suggests that commercial installations are driven mostly by its promise of financial returns, and continued growth in this market segment is likely to depend on falling installation costs and availability of incentives.}

It focuses on forecasts of energy use in the United States for the year 2000 but considers only long-term predictions, i.e., those covering two or more decades. The motivation is current interest in global warming forecasts, some of which run beyond a century. The basic observation is that forecasters in the 1950--1980 period underestimated the importance of unmodeled surprises. A key example is the failure to foresee the ability of the United States economy to respond to the oil embargos of the 1970s by increasing efficiency. Not only were most forecasts of that period systematically high, but forecasters systematically underestimated uncertainties. Long-term energy forecasts must make assumptions about both technologies and social systems. At their most successful, they influence how people act by showing the consequences of not acting. They are useful when they provide insights to energy planners, influence the perceptions of the public and the energy policy community, capture current understanding of underlying physical and economic principles, or highlight key emerging social or economic trends. It is true that at best we see dimly into the future, but those who acknowledge their duty to posterity will feel impelled to use their foresight upon what facts and guiding principles we do possess. Though many data are at present wanting or doubtful, our conclusions may be rendered so far probable as to lead to further inquiries{\dots} (1), p. 4.}

Here we explore how models have consistently underestimated PV deployment and identify the reasons for underlying bias in models.

For regions with highly diverse energy sources, such as the United States, it's important to not only analyze public perceptions of various energy sources, but also examine relative levels of support for energy transition policies. We examine public perceptions of two energy sources, coal and solar energy, as well as the public's support for energy transition policies that assist the transition from coal to renewable energy, specifically solar. To better understand how place influences attitudes and policies of coal and solar, we sampled respondents from three areas with varying ties to coal and solar: Saline County, IL, Houston, TX, and Burlington, VT. Our results suggest that one's place has an important effect in differentiating the public perceptions of renewable and nonrenewable energy and for support in an energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. While residents of places with historical attachment to coal mining have positive attitudes toward coal, our data show that they have even more positive attitudes toward sustainable energy sources. These attitudes hold for future development and government assistance. If federal or state governments seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (and consequently energy from coal, a major source of greenhouse gases), solar and other sustainable energy policies need to be targeted at places with historical ties to coal and other fossil fuels to ensure a procedurally just energy transition.}

But questions arise how such a system should be structured, which techniques should be used and, of course, how costly it might be. These questions were the focus of a study which investigated the cost optimum of a future renewable electricity supply for Europe and its closer Asian and African neighbourhood. The resulting scenarios are based on a broad data basis of the electricity consumption and for renewable energies. A linear optimisation determines the best system configuration and temporal dispatch of all components. The outcome of the scenarios can be considered as being a scientific breakthrough since it proves that a totally renewable electricity supply is possible even with current technology and at the same time is affordable for our national economies. In the conservative base case scenario, wind power would dominate the production spread over the better wind areas within the whole supply area, connected with the demand centres via HVDC transmission. The transmission system, furthermore, powerfully integrates the existing storage hydropower to provide for backup coequally assisted by biomass power and supported by solar thermal electricity. The main results of the different scenarios can be summarized as follows: {$\bullet$} A totally renewable electricity supply for Europe and its neighbourhood is possible and affordable.}

However, the classical method of computing this metric requires substantial reliability modeling and an iterative process that is quite computationally intensive. Consequently, a noniterative method of estimating a wind plant's ELCC is proposed in this paper. Inspired by Garver's approximation and derived based on well-known reliability concepts, the proposed method provides an excellent approximation while requiring only minimal reliability modeling and no computationally-intensive iterative process. It computes ELCC estimates from a single function using only the wind plant's multistate probabilistic representation and a graphically determined parameter that characterizes the existing power system. After presenting the complete mathematical derivation of this function, the method is applied to compute the ELCC estimates of various wind plants at different penetration levels. It is shown that the resultant ELCC estimates only slightly overestimate the classically computed values by relative errors of 2.5\% or less. Furthermore, the proposed method yields more accurate ELCC estimates than the capacity factor approximation, which is commonly used to approximate the ELCC of a wind plant.}

Given the uncertainty in future retail rates and the inherent links between rates and the customer-economics of behind-the-meter PV, there is growing interest in understanding how potential changes in rates may impact the value of bill savings from PV. In this article, we first use a production cost and capacity expansion model to project California hourly wholesale electricity market prices under two potential electricity market scenarios, including a reference and a 33\% renewables scenario. Second, based on the wholesale electricity market prices generated by the model, we develop retail rates (i.e., flat, time-of-use, and real-time pricing) for each future scenario based on standard retail rate design principles. Finally, based on these retail rates, the bill savings from PV is estimated for 226 California residential customers under two types of net metering, for each scenario. We find that high renewable penetrations can drive substantial changes in residential retail rates and that these changes, together with variations in retail rate structures and PV compensation mechanisms, interact to place substantial uncertainty on the future value of bill savings from residential PV. {\copyright} 2014.},

  abstract = {The substantial increase in deployment of customer-sited solar photovoltaics (PV) in the United States has been driven by a combination of steeply declining costs, financing innovations, and supportive policies. Among those supportive policies is net metering, which in most states effectively allows customers to receive compensation for distributed PV generation at the full retail electricity price. The current design of retail electricity rates and the presence of net metering have elicited concerns that the possible under-recovery of fixed utility costs from PV system owners may lead to a feedback loop of increasing retail prices that accelerate PV adoption and further rate increases. However, a separate and opposing feedback loop could offset this effect: increased PV deployment may lead to a shift in the timing of peak-period electricity prices that could reduce the bill savings received under net metering where time-varying retail electricity rates are used, thereby dampening further PV adoption. In this paper, we examine the impacts of these two competing feedback dynamics on U.S. distributed PV deployment through 2050 for both residential and commercial customers, across states. Our results indicate that, at the aggregate national level, the two feedback effects nearly offset one another and therefore produce a modest net effect, although their magnitude and direction vary by customer segment and by state. We also model aggregate PV deployment trends under various rate designs and net-metering rules, accounting for feedback dynamics. Our results demonstrate that future adoption of distributed PV is highly sensitive to retail rate structures. Whereas flat, time-invariant rates with net metering lead to higher aggregate national deployment levels than the current mix of rate structures (+5\% in 2050), rate structures with higher monthly fixed customer charges or PV compensation at levels lower than the full retail rate can dramatically erode aggregate customer adoption of PV (from -14\% to -61\%, depending on the design). Moving towards time-varying rates, on the other hand, accelerates near- and medium-term deployment (through 2030) but slows adoption in the longer term (-22\% in 2050).},

Number of rooms, heating source and house age were key variables that had not been previously explored in the literature, but are consistent with the expected profile of a PV adopter. The strong relationship provided by foreclosure indicators and mortgage status have less of an intuitive connection to PV adoption, but may be highly correlated with characteristics inherent in PV adopters. Next, we explore how these predictive factors and model performance varies between different Investor Owned Utility (IOU) regions in California, and at different spatial scales. Results suggest that models trained with small subsets of geospatial information (five to eight variables) may provide similar explanatory power as models using hundreds of geospatial variables. Further, the predictive performance of models generally decreases at higher resolution, i.e., below ZIP code level since several geospatial variables with coarse native resolution become less useful for representing high resolution variations in PV adoption trends. However, for California we find that model performance improves if parameters are trained at the regional IOU level rather than the state-wide level. We also find that models trained within one IOU region are generally representative for other IOU regions in CA, suggesting that a model trained with data from one state may be applicable in another state.},

  abstract = {Nuclear power has long been controversial because of concerns about nuclear accidents, storage of spent fuel, and how the spread of nuclear power might raise risks of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. These concerns are real and important. However, emphasizing these concerns implicitly suggests that unless these issues are taken into account, nuclear power would otherwise be cost effective compared to other forms of electricity generation. This implication is unwarranted. Throughout the history of nuclear power, a key challenge has been the high cost of construction for nuclear plants. Construction costs are high enough that it becomes difficult to make an economic argument for nuclear even before incorporating these external factors. This is particularly true in countries like the United States where recent technological advances have dramatically increased the availability of natural gas. The chairman of one of the largest U.S. nuclear companies recently said that his company would not break ground on a new nuclear plant until the price of natural gas was more than double today's level and carbon emissions cost \$25 per ton. This comment summarizes the current economics of nuclear power pretty well. Yes, there is a certain confluence of factors that could make nuclear power a viable economic option. Otherwise, a nuclear power renaissance seems unlikely.},

The sensitivity of the rating to different environmental parameters and the impact of changing the voltage limit are also investigated.},

This paper combines the thermal model for overhead lines with the transformer thermal model, to investigate the impact of environmental conditions on both.

The impact of a higher thermal limit on the loss of life of the transformer is compared to the amount of curtailed wind and the potential revenue from the added wind farm.

Here, we examine the energy systems of 177 net-zero scenarios and discuss their long-term technological and regional characteristics in the context of current energy policies. We find that, on average, renewable energy sources account for 60\% of primary energy at net-zero (compared to {$\sim$}14\% today), with slightly less than half of that renewable energy derived from biomass. Meanwhile, electricity makes up approximately half of final energy consumed (compared to {$\sim$}20\% today), highlighting the extent to which solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels remain prevalent in the scenarios even when emissions reach net-zero. Finally, residual emissions and offsetting negative emissions are not evenly distributed across world regions, which may have important implications for negotiations on burden-sharing, human development, and equity.},

The purpose is to compare the relative characteristics of the scenarios, focusing on the amount and types of flexibility used and the predicted electricity generation cost. The approach included the screening of 45 studies (some of which contained multiple scenarios) to down-select to 8 studies, which used high-fidelity short-term energy system models. The compared scenarios applied many strategies for providing flexibility, which was found to be a crucial and significant component of a 100\% RE system. Accordingly, only two of the fifteen examined scenarios contained a variable generation fraction greater than 65\% of total scenario capacity (73\% and 69\%). Predicted electricity costs varied drastically in all regions. Some studies provided multiple scenarios (including business-as-usual scenarios and costs) that could be compared. In 3 out of the 4 studies including a business-as-usual cost, the 100\% RE scenarios were found to be between 41\% and 104\% more expensive. The fourth study showed electricity costs to be the same for a 100\% RE system and business-as-usual system, and the 100\% RE system to be 62\% cheaper when externalities are included.}

Granted most PV farm locations don't necessarily have great wind resources, most land-based wind parks are under-utilizing the land they occupy by not collecting the solar radiation being cast in between the turbines. Because the price of photovoltaic systems has dropped dramatically over the past few years, the addition of PV panels to already existing, as well as planned, wind energy projects has become economically advantageous. In this paper a framework will be presented to optimize such an upgrade or plan a future project in order to maximize the returns for the operating utility. The approach will be using a genetic algorithm and minimization function to find the exact number and placement of wind turbines and solar panels given hourly solar irradiance, temperature, wind speed and wind direction data at the location. The fitness function will use models to accurately estimate the yearly energy produced considering the wake effects of upwind turbines and the shadows these will cast on the panels. Each configuration will then be evaluated using industry financial models in order to maximize the return on investment.},

  abstract = {The power system is expected to play an important role in climate change mitigation. Variable renewable energy (VRE) sources, such as wind and solar power, are currently showing rapid growth rates in power systems worldwide, and could also be important in future mitigation strategies. It is therefore important that the electricity sector and the integration of VRE are correctly represented in energy models. This paper presents an improved methodology for representing the electricity sector in the long-term energy simulation model TIMER using a heuristic approach to find cost optimal paths given system requirements and scenario assumptions. Regional residual load duration curves have been included to simulate curtailments, storage use, backup requirements and system load factor decline as the VRE share increases. The results show that for the USA and Western Europe at lower VRE penetration levels, backup costs form the major VRE cost markup. When solar power supplies more than 30\% of the electricity demand, the costs of storage and energy curtailments become increasingly important. Storage and curtailments have less influence on wind power cost markups in these regions, as wind power supply is better correlated with electricity demand. Mitigation scenarios show an increasing VRE share in the electricity mix implying also increasing contribution of VRE for peak and mid load capacity. In the current scenarios, this can be achieved by at the same time installing less capital intensive gas fired power plants. Sensitivity analysis showed that greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector in the updated model are particularly sensitive to the availability of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear power and the costs of VRE.}

Our method accurately reproduces CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions for multiple U.S. NERC regions and years and enables us to analyze future scenarios that are absent from the historical data. Though historically derived regression-based MEFs are generally more accurate, our simulated MEFs provide a more nuanced picture of how clusters of low- or high-emitting power plants of similar production cost create large swings in MEFs throughout the day. Policymakers could use these dynamic MEFs to target demand-reduction strategies at high-emissions portions of the power plant merit order.},

  abstract = {Adding large solar photovoltaic (PV) resources into an electric grid influences the flexibility characteristics of its net load profile. The dispatch of the existing generation fleet changes as it adjusts to accommodate the new net load. This study categorizes and defines these flexibility characteristics. It utilizes a unit commitment and dispatch (UC\&D) model to simulate large solar generation assets with different geographic locations and orientations. The simulations show the sensitivity of the wholesale energy price, reserve market prices, total dispatch cost, fuel mix, emissions, and water use to changes in net load flexibility requirements. The results show that generating 22,500GWh of solar energy in a 2011 simulation of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) reduces total dispatch cost by approximately \$900million (a 10.3\% decrease) while increasing ancillary services costs by approximately \$10million (a 3\% increase). The results also show that PV reduces water consumption and water withdrawals as well as CO2, NOx, and SOx emissions. It also reduces peak load by 4\% but increases net load volatility by 40--79\% and ramping by 11--33\%. In addition, west-located, west-oriented solar resources reduce total dispatch cost more than the other simulated solar scenarios. The west-located, west-oriented solar simulation required greater system flexibility, but utilized more low-cost generators and fewer high-cost generators for energy production than other simulated scenarios. These results suggest that the mix of energy provided by different generation technologies influences the dispatch cost more than the net load flexibility requirements.},

Using annual data on photovoltaic module prices, cumulative production, R\&D knowledge stock and input prices for silicon and silver over the period 1990--2011, we identify a experience curve model which minimizes the difference between predicted and actual module prices. This model predicts a 67\% decrease of module price from 2011 to 2020. This rate implies that the cost of PV generated electricity will reach that of conventional electricity by 2020 in the sunniest countries with annual solar irradiation of 2000~kWh/year or more, such as California, Italy, and Spain.}

Here, we discuss methods of addressing the variability of WWS energy to ensure that power supply reliably matches demand (including interconnecting geographically dispersed resources, using hydroelectricity, using demand-response management, storing electric power on site, over-sizing peak generation capacity and producing hydrogen with the excess, storing electric power in vehicle batteries, and forecasting weather to project energy supplies), the economics of WWS generation and transmission, the economics of WWS use in transportation, and policy measures needed to enhance the viability of a WWS system. We find that the cost of energy in a 100\% WWS will be similar to the cost today. We conclude that barriers to a 100\% conversion to WWS power worldwide are primarily social and political, not technological or even economic.}

It looks in detail at the various energy-using activities within each demand sector, charting their volume and physical energy intensities over time. The approach pays particular attention to maximising energy efficiency through the use of best available technologies. This leads to a reduction in total energy demand and a high share of electricity. The decrease in overall demand is achieved despite a growth in both, population and volume of energy services. The electrification occurs primarily in the Buildings and Transport sectors. We conclude that we can build a global energy system by 2050 which sources 95\% of its energy from sustainable sources following an ambitious, but feasible pathway. The pathway is considered achievable because it is based on currently available technology and realistic deployment rates. Policy measures are necessary in all sectors to provide incentives for the transition and we briefly discuss the requirements for these policies. The energy system we propose is robust with respect to (small) variations in the pathway as it only uses a small fraction of each of the sustainable sources.}

  abstract = {Both renewable and nuclear energy can provide significant contributions to decarbonizing the electric sector. However, a grid employing large amounts of wind and solar energy requires the balance of the system to be highly flexible to respond to the increased variability of the net load. This makes deployment of conventional nuclear power challenging both due to the technical challenges of plant cycling and economic limits of reduced capacity factor. In the United States nuclear power plants generally provide constant, base load power and are most economic when operated at constant power levels. Operating nuclear power plants in load-following modes decreases the plants' annual energy output and increases the levelized cost of energy, decreasing economic competitiveness. One possible solution is to couple thermal energy storage to nuclear power plants. This would enable the reactor to remain at nearly constant output, while cycling the electrical generator in response to the variability of the net load. This paper conceptually explores combinations of wind, solar, and nuclear that can provide a large fraction of a system's electricity, assuming the use of thermal energy storage that would allow nuclear power to provide load following and cycling duty while operating at a constant reactor power output.}

  abstract = {In this work, we examine some of the limits to large-scale deployment of solar photovoltaics (PV) in traditional electric power systems. Specifically, we evaluate the ability of PV to provide a large fraction (up to 50\%) of a utility system's energy by comparing hourly output of a simulated large PV system to the amount of electricity actually usable. The simulations use hourly recorded solar insolation and load data for Texas in the year 2000 and consider the constraints of traditional electricity generation plants to reduce output and accommodate intermittent PV generation. We find that under high penetration levels and existing grid-operation procedures and rules, the system will have excess PV generation during certain periods of the year. Several metrics are developed to examine this excess PV generation and resulting costs as a function of PV penetration at different levels of system flexibility. The limited flexibility of base load generators produces increasingly large amounts of unusable PV generation when PV provides perhaps 10--20\% of a system's energy. Measures to increase PV penetration beyond this range will be discussed and quantified in a follow-up analysis.}

  abstract = {We examine the changes to the electric power system required to incorporate high penetration of variable wind and solar electricity generation in a transmission constrained grid. Simulations were performed in the Texas, US (ERCOT) grid where different mixes of wind, solar photovoltaic and concentrating solar power meet up to 80\% of the electric demand. The primary constraints on incorporation of these sources at large scale are the limited time coincidence of the resource with normal electricity demand, combined with the limited flexibility of thermal generators to reduce output. An additional constraint in the ERCOT system is the current inability to exchange power with neighboring grids. By themselves, these constraints would result in unusable renewable generation and increased costs. But a highly flexible system -- with must-run baseload generators virtually eliminated -- allows for penetrations of up to about 50\% variable generation with curtailment rates of less than 10\%. For penetration levels up to 80\% of the system's electricity demand, keeping curtailments to less than 10\% requires a combination of load shifting and storage equal to about one day of average demand.}

We find that the overall average solar electric footprint is about 181m2 per person in a base case scenario, with a state- and scenario-dependant range from about 50 to over 450m2 per person. Two key factors that influence the magnitude of the state-level solar electric footprint include how industrial energy is allocated (based on location of use vs. where goods are consumed) and the assumed distribution of PV configurations (flat rooftop vs. fixed tilt vs. tracking). We also compare the solar electric footprint to a number of other land uses. For example, we find that the base case solar electric footprint is equal to less than 2\% of the land dedicated to cropland and grazing in the United States, and less than the current amount of land used for corn ethanol production.}

Of particular focus are batteries with 4-h duration due to rules in several regions along with these batteries' potential to achieve life-cycle cost parity with combustion turbines compared to longer-duration batteries. However, whether 4-h energy storage can provide peak capacity depends largely on the shape of electricity demand. Under historical grid conditions, beyond about 28~GW nationally the ability of 4-h batteries to provide peak capacity begins to fall. We find that the addition of renewable generation can significantly increase storage's potential by changing the shape of net demand patterns; for example, beyond about 10\% penetration of solar photovoltaics, the national practical potential for 4-h storage to provide peak capacity doubles. The impact of wind generation is less clear and likely requires more detailed study considering the exchange of wind power across multiple regions.},

The simulations used a utility production cost model to evaluate a series of PV penetrations where up to 10\% of the region's electricity is derived from PV. The analysis focused on California, which uses gas for a large fraction of its generation and Colorado, which derives most of its electricity from coal. PV displaces gas and electricity imports almost exclusively in California, with a displacement rate of about 6000-9000 kJ per kWh of PV energy generated. In Colorado, PV offsets mostly gas at low penetration, with increasing coal displacement during nonsummer months and at higher penetration. Associated reductions in CO(2), NO(x), and SO(2) emissions are also calculated.},

Co-location of wind and storage decreases transmission requirements, but also decreases the economic value of energy storage compared to locating energy storage at the load. This represents a tradeoff which we examine to estimate the transmission costs required to justify moving storage from load-sited to wind-sited in three different locations in the United States. We examined compressed air energy storage (CAES) in three "wind by wire" scenarios with a variety of transmission and CAES sizes relative to a given amount of wind. In the sites and years evaluated, the optimal amount of transmission ranges from 60\% to 100\% of the wind farm rating, with the optimal amount of CAES equal to 0-35\% of the wind farm rating, depending heavily on wind resource, value of electricity in the local market, and the cost of natural gas.

  abstract = {Electrical energy storage could play an important role in decarbonizing the electricity sector by offering a new, carbon-free source of operational flexibility, improving the utilization of generation assets, and facilitating the integration of variable renewable energy sources. Yet, the future cost of energy storage technologies is uncertain, and the value that they can bring to the system depends on multiple factors. Moreover, the marginal value of storage diminishes as more energy storage capacity is deployed. To explore the potential value of energy storage in deep decarbonization of the electricity sector, we assess the impact of increasing levels of energy storage capacity on both power system operations and investments in generation capacity using a generation capacity expansion model with detailed unit commitment constraints. In a case study of a system with load and renewable resource characteristics from the U.S. state of Texas, we find that energy storage delivers value by increasing the cost-effective penetration of renewable energy, reducing total investments in nuclear power and gas-fired peaking units, and improving the utilization of all installed capacity. However, we find that the value delivered by energy storage with a 2-hour storage capacity only exceeds current technology costs under strict emissions limits, implying that substantial cost reductions in battery storage are needed to justify large-scale deployment. In contrast, storage resources with a 10-hour storage capacity deliver value consistent with the current cost of pumped hydroelectric storage. In general, while energy storage appears essential to enable decarbonization strategies dependent on very high shares of wind and solar energy, storage is not a requisite if a diverse mix of flexible, low-carbon power sources is employed, including flexible nuclear power.}

  abstract = {In this study, a 100\% renewable energy (RE) system for Brazil in 2030 was simulated using an hourly resolution model. The optimal sets of RE technologies, mix of capacities, operation modes and least cost energy supply were calculated and the role of storage technologies was analysed. The RE generated was not only able to fulfil the electricity demand of the power sector but also able to cover the 25\% increase in total electricity demand due to water desalination and synthesis of natural gas for industrial use. The results for the power sector show that the total installed capacity is formed of 165 GW of solar photovoltaics (PV), 85 GW of hydro dams, 12 GW of hydro run-of-river, 8 GW of biogas, 12 GW of biomass and 8 GW of wind power. For solar PV and wind electricity storage, 243 GWhel of battery capacity is needed. According to the simulations the existing hydro dams will function similarly to batteries, being an essential electricity storage. 1 GWh of pumped hydro storage, 23 GWh of adiabatic compressed air storage and 1 GWh of heat storage are used as well. The small storage capacities can be explained by a high availability of RE sources with low seasonal variability and an existing electricity sector mainly based on hydro dams. Therefore, only 0.05 GW of PtG technologies are needed for seasonal storage in the electricity sector. When water desalination and industrial gas sectors' electricity demand are integrated to the power sector, a reduction of 11\% in both total cost and electric energy generation was achieved. The total system levelized cost of electricity decreased from 61 {\texteuro}/MWh to 53 {\texteuro}/MWh for the sector integration.}

Introducing a strong decarbonisation constraint, for instance, profoundly modifies the power sector, which is impacted by increasing shares of variable renewable energy sources. Long-term modelling tools working on different assumptions increasingly factor in these impacts, the assessment of which requires a clear description and categorization of the technical and economic choices for representing the tools in question. A new typology based on a literature review is presented for both power sector models and long-term models of the energy system. New comparing criteria focussing on the power sector's components are put forward, such as electricity storage and grid. An analysis carried out by means of this categorization on five chosen models shows that, up until now, energy modelling tools and power system tools have been designed to meet separate objectives and have not combined their advantages.}

The four RCPs together span the range of year 2100 radiative forcing values found in the open literature, i.e. from 2.6 to 8.5 W/m2. The RCPs are the product of an innovative collaboration between integrated assessment modelers, climate modelers, terrestrial ecosystem modelers and emission inventory experts. The resulting product forms a comprehensive data set with high spatial and sectoral resolutions for the period extending to 2100. Land use and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are reported mostly at a 0.5 {\texttimes} 0.5 degree spatial resolution, with air pollutants also provided per sector (for well-mixed gases, a coarser resolution is used). The underlying integrated assessment model outputs for land use, atmospheric emissions and concentration data were harmonized across models and scenarios to ensure consistency with historical observations while preserving individual scenario trends. For most variables, the RCPs cover a wide range of the existing literature. The RCPs are supplemented with extensions (Extended Concentration Pathways, ECPs), which allow climate modeling experiments through the year 2300. The RCPs are an important development in climate research and provide a potential foundation for further research and assessment, including emissions mitigation and impact analysis.},

First, we find hysteretic multicycles for such nanomagnets. The simulation uses continuous spin dynamics through the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. In some regions of parameter space, the probability of finding a multicycle is as high as {$\sim$}0.6. We find that systems with larger and more anisotropic nanomagnets tend to display more multicycles. Our results also demonstrate the importance of disorder and frustration for multicycle behavior. Second, we show that there is a fundamental difference between the more realistic vector LLG equation and scalar models of hysteresis, such as Ising models. In the latter case spin and external field inversion symmetry is obeyed, but in the former it is destroyed by the dynamics, with important experimental implications.}

Recent coherent x-ray speckle experiments on magnetic films have measured the loss of correlation between configurations at opposite fields and at the same field, upon repeated field cycling. We perform finite temperature numerical simulations on these systems that provide a comprehensive explanation for the experimental results. The simulations demonstrate, in accordance with experiments, that the memory of configurations increases with film disorder. We find that nontrivial microscopic differences exist between the zero field spin configuration obtained by starting from a large positive field and the zero field configuration starting at a large negative field. This seemingly paradoxical behavior is due to the nature of the vector spin dynamics and is also seen in the experiments. For low disorder, there is an instability which causes the spontaneous growth of linelike domains at a critical field, also in accord with experiments. It is this unstable growth, which is highly sensitive to thermal noise, that is responsible for the small correlation between patterns under repeated cycling. The domain patterns, hysteresis loops, and memory properties of our simulated systems match remarkably well with the real experimental systems.}

To improve reliability and independence of energy supplies, the U.S. and many other countries are seeking internally-sourced renewable energy; solar is one such renewable-energy source that meets these criteria. However, all energy sources exert some environmental impacts. In the case of solar, direct impacts stem mostly from alteration of land needed to host infrastructure. Understanding the environmental upside and downside potential of solar energy systems allows a more comprehensive, side-by-side comparison with different energy sources. In this article, we focus on the solar energy potential of West Texas, USA, a large arid to semi-arid region with a rural population and favorable climatic conditions. Texas is an interesting and important region to study given its unregulated and independent grid operation and the additional (and substantial) sources of regionally produced energy. Herein, we assess the geographic and environmental attributes, constraints to (e.g., incoming solar radiation, slope, habitats, ecoregion, water availability, etc.), and the potential environmental impacts on land resources from utility-scale installations of different types of solar energy generation systems. Our assessment points to the balance needed to expand solar energy to gain flexibility in energy sourcing on the one hand, while carefully considering future locations and technology to avoid regional impacts to land and environmental resources.}

As a result, supporters of the politically powerful incumbent industries and others are critiquing the feasibility of large-scale electricity generating systems based predominantly on RE. Part of this opposition is manifest in the publication of incorrect myths about renewable electricity (RElec) in scholarly journals, popular articles, media, websites, blogs and statements by politicians. The aim of the present article is to use current scientific and engineering theory and practice to refute the principal myths. It does this by showing that large-scale electricity systems that are 100\% renewable (100RElec), including those whose renewable sources are predominantly variable (e.g. wind and solar PV), can be readily designed to meet the key requirements of reliability, security and affordability. It also argues that transition to 100RElec could occur much more rapidly than suggested by historical energy transitions. It finds that the main critiques published in scholarly articles and books contain factual errors, questionable assumptions, important omissions, internal inconsistencies, exaggerations of limitations and irrelevant arguments. Some widely publicised critiques select criteria that are inappropriate and/or irrelevant to the assessment of energy technologies, ignore studies whose results contradict arguments in the critiques, and fail to assess the sum total of knowledge provided collectively by the published studies on 100RElec, but instead demand that each individual study address all the critiques' inappropriate criteria. We find that the principal barriers to 100RElec are neither technological nor economic, but instead are primarily political, institutional and cultural.}

Existing capacity expansion models do not integrate land use land cover change (LULC) dynamics into projections. We explored the interaction between projected LULC, solar photovoltaic (PV) deployment, and solar impacts on natural lands and croplands by integrating projections of LULC with a model that can project future deployment of solar PV with high spatial resolution for the conterminous United States. We used scenarios of LULC projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emission Scenarios from 2010 to 2050 and two electricity grid scenarios to model future PV deployment and compared those results against a baseline that held 2010 land cover constant through 2050. Though solar PV's overall technical potential was minimally impacted by LULC scenarios, deployed PV varied by -16.5 to 11.6~\% in 2050 from the baseline scenario. Total land requirements for projected PV were similar to other studies, but measures of PV impacts on natural systems depended on the underlying land change dynamics occurring in a scenario. The solar PV deployed through 2050 resulted in 1.1~\%--2.4~\% of croplands and 0.3~\%--0.7~\% of natural lands being converted to PV. However, the deepest understanding of PV impacts and interactions with land cover emerged when the complete net gains and losses from all land cover change dynamics, including PV, were integrated. For example, one of the four LULC projections allows for high solar development and a net gain in natural lands, even though PV drives a larger percentage of natural land conversion. This paper shows that integrating land cover change dynamics with energy expansion models generates new insights into trade offs between decarbonization, impacts of renewables, and ongoing land cover change.}

Even with the increase in flexible storage capacity, the policy still jeopardizes power system reliability by increasing occurrences of over or under generation.

The stand-alone PV system was shown to provide the most value; however due to the increased difficulty of PV systems being approved for grid interconnection in Hawaii, it is valuable to install an AC or DC connected battery to enable full PV self-consumption under a less restrictive interconnection option. In that case both battery systems enabled full PV selfconsumption at the residence, requiring no power to be exported to the grid. The DC-connected battery system captured energy from the PV array which would have also been clipped due to inverter limitations. For a PV system with DC/AC ratio of 1.23, the battery configurations produced net-present values within 1\% of each other, but when the DC/AC ratio increased to 1.85, the DC-connected system increased the net-present value by 13\%.}

  abstract = {This paper presents the results of numerous commercial and residential building simulations, with the purpose of examining the impact of climate change on peak and annual building energy consumption over the portion of the EIC (Eastern Interconnection) located in the United States. The climate change scenario considered includes changes in mean climate characteristics as well as changes in the frequency and duration of intense weather events. Simulations were performed using the BEND (Building ENergy Demand) model which is a detailed building analysis platform utilizing EnergyPlus™ as the simulation engine. Over 26,000 building configurations of different types, sizes, vintages, and characteristics representing the population of buildings within the EIC, are modeled across the three EIC time zones using the future climate from 100 target region locations, resulting in nearly 180,000 spatially relevant simulated demand profiles for three years selected to be representative of the general climate trend over the century. This approach provides a heretofore unprecedented level of specificity across multiple spectrums including spatial, temporal, and building characteristics. This capability enables the ability to perform detailed hourly impact studies of building adaptation and mitigation strategies on energy use and electricity peak demand within the context of the entire grid and economy.}

  abstract = {Power transmission network reinforcements must be carefully evaluated to ensure economic, secure, and reliable delivery of electricity. Transmission expansion planning (TEP) models, which seek to optimize the timing, location, and voltages of new transmission lines, can be useful for this task. In general, such models can be mixed-integer nonconvex models due to the discrete nature of investments and AC power flow representations. The original nonconvex TEP model (i.e., ACTEP) is approximated as a linear model (i.e., DCTEP) in most studies. However, the accuracy of this TEP approximation has not been quantified for large-scale power systems. In this paper, we first propose a large-scale test system for ACTEP studies, which addresses drawbacks of existing test systems. An ACTEP global solver (i.e., Global-TEP) is used to obtain global solutions of the proposed test system with a guaranteed optimality gap, which allows it to serve as a benchmark for future ACTEP studies. Then, differences among solutions of four TEP models (i.e., DCTEP, local solution of ACTEP, global solution of ACTEP, and global solution of ACTEP with reactive power compensator expansion) are quantified. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative comparison of DCTEP vs. ACTEP global solutions on a large-scale system. Since a significant difference is observed between the DCTEP and ACTEP solutions, and since the DCTEP solution's performance is significantly worse when verified by an AC load flow model, considering the exact AC power flow representations in TEP studies is recommended.},

  abstract = {Renewable sources are increasing their presence in power systems to achieve the goal of decarbonizing the generation of electricity. However, the variability of these resources introduces high uncertainty in the operation of a power system and, hence, fast generating and storage units must be incorporated in the system. To obtain economically and technically efficient solutions in the capacity expansion problem, an adequate representation of the variability of the renewable resource is crucial, but this may increase the size of the problem up to computational intractability. The most suitable representation is often selected through clustering techniques. The clustering algorithms proposed in the literature suffer from a significant trade-off between their ability to capture the inter-temporal correlation of the clustered elements and the representativeness of the clusters when only very few are needed. This paper proposes an innovative clustering technique that overcomes this trade-off. A case study based on the European power system is solved. The outcomes given by the new clustering algorithm and other well-known techniques are investigated through in-sample and out-of-sample analyses applied to multiple cases that differ in to the number of clusters and the minimum renewable production.},

  abstract = {South East Europe is the region in a part of Europe with approximately 65.5 million inhabitants, making up 8.9\% of Europe's total population. The countries concerned have distinct geographical features, various climates and significant differences in gross domestic product per capita, so the integration of their energy systems is considered to be a challenging task. Large differences between energy mixes, still largely dominated by fossil-fuel consumption, make this task even more demanding. This paper presents the transition steps to a 100\% renewable energy system which need to be carried out until the year 2050 in order to achieve zero carbon energy society. Novelty of this paper compared to other papers with similar research goals is the assumed sustainable use of biomass in the 100\% renewable energy system of the region considered. It is important to emphasize here that only the sustainable use of biomass can be considered carbon-neutral. The resulting biomass consumption of the model was 725.94PJ for the entire region, which is in line with the biomass potential of the region. Modelling the zero-carbon energy system was carried out using the smart energy system concept, together with its main integration pillars, i.e. power-to-heat and power-to-gas technologies. The resulting power generation mix shows that a wide variety of energy sources need to be utilized and no single energy source has more than a 30\% share, which also increases the security of supply. Wind turbines and photovoltaics are the main technologies with shares of 28.9\% and 22.5\%, followed by hydro power, concentrated solar power, biomass (mainly used in cogeneration units) and geothermal energy sources. To keep the biomass consumption within the sustainability limits, there is a need for some type of synthetic fuel in the transportation sector. Nevertheless, achieving 100\% renewable energy system also promises to be financially beneficial, as the total calculated annual socio-economic cost of the region is approximately 20 billion euros lower in the year 2050 than in the base year. Finally, energy efficiency measures will play an important role in the transition to the zero-carbon energy society: the model shows that primary energy supply will be 50.9\% lower than in the base year.}

This power flow limit (line thermal rating) varies with weather conditions along the line corridor but, for simplicity, static line ratings (SLR) are normally calculated for ``suitably conservative'' annual or seasonal weather conditions. Dynamic line ratings (DLR) change with the real-time weather conditions along the line, are usually higher than SLR, and are more complex to use in system operation. Forecasting of DLR requires forecasting of line corridor weather conditions but makes DLR more useful to power system operations. This paper discusses DLR methods including forecast techniques and presents various field applications.},

  abstract = {Wind integration studies are an important tool for understanding the effects of increasing wind power deployment on grid reliability and system costs. This paper provides a detailed review of the statistical methods and results from 12 large-scale regional wind integration studies. In particular, we focus our review on the modeling methods and conclusions associated with estimating short-term balancing reserves (regulation and load-following). Several important observations proceed from this review. First, we found that many of the studies either explicitly or implicitly assume that wind power step-change data follow exponential probability distributions, such as the Gaussian distribution. To understand the importance of this issue we compared empirical wind power data to Gaussian data. The results illustrate that the Gaussian assumption significantly underestimates the frequency of very large changes in wind power, and thus may lead to an underestimation of undesirable reliability effects and of operating costs. Secondly, most of these studies make extensive use of wind speed data generated from mesoscale numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. We compared the wind speed data from NWP models with empirical data and found that the NWP data have substantially less power spectral energy, a measure of variability, at higher frequencies relative to the empirical wind data. To the extent that this difference results in reduced high-frequency variability in the simulated wind power plants, studies using this approach could underestimate the need for fast ramping balancing resources. On the other hand, the magnitude of this potential underestimation is uncertain, largely because the methods used for estimating balancing reserve requirements depend on a number of heuristics, several of which are discussed in this review. Finally, we compared the power systems modeling methods used in the studies and suggest potential areas where research and development can reduce uncertainty in future wind integration studies.}

  abstract = {Abstract             The High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) is a convection-allowing implementation of the Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) Model with hourly data assimilation that covers the conterminous United States and Alaska and runs in real time at the NOAA/National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Implemented operationally at NOAA/NCEP in 2014, the HRRR features 3-km horizontal grid spacing and frequent forecasts (hourly for CONUS and 3-hourly for Alaska). HRRR initialization is designed for optimal short-range forecast skill with a particular focus on the evolution of precipitating systems. Key components of the initialization are radar-reflectivity data assimilation, hybrid ensemble-variational assimilation of conventional weather observations, and a cloud analysis to initialize stratiform cloud layers. From this initial state, HRRR forecasts are produced out to 18 h every hour, and out to 48 h every 6 h, with boundary conditions provided by the Rapid Refresh system. Between 2014 and 2020, HRRR development was focused on reducing model bias errors and improving forecast realism and accuracy. Improved representation of the planetary boundary layer, subgrid-scale clouds, and land surface contributed extensively to overall HRRR improvements. The final version of the HRRR (HRRRv4), implemented in late 2020, also features hybrid data assimilation using flow-dependent covariances from a 3-km, 36-member ensemble (``HRRRDAS'') with explicit convective storms. HRRRv4 also includes prediction of wildfire smoke plumes. The HRRR provides a baseline capability for evaluating NOAA's next-generation Rapid Refresh Forecast System, now under development.                            Significance Statement               NOAA's operational hourly updating, convection-allowing model, the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), is a key tool for short-range weather forecasting and situational awareness. Improvements in assimilation of weather observations, as well as in physics parameterizations, have led to improvements in simulated radar reflectivity and quantitative precipitation forecasts since the initial implementation of HRRR in September 2014. Other targeted development has focused on improved representation of the diurnal cycle of the planetary boundary layer, resulting in improved near-surface temperature and humidity forecasts. Additional physics and data assimilation changes have led to improved treatment of the development and erosion of low-level clouds, including subgrid-scale clouds. The final version of HRRR features storm-scale ensemble data assimilation and explicit prediction of wildfire smoke plumes.},

  abstract = {Summary Reliable and affordable electricity systems based on variable energy sources, such as wind and solar may depend on the ability to store large quantities of low-cost energy over long timescales. Here, we use 39 years of hourly U.S. weather data, and a macro-scale energy model to evaluate capacities and dispatch in least cost, 100\% reliable electricity systems with wind and solar generation supported by long-duration storage (LDS; 10~h or greater) and battery storage. We find that the introduction of LDS lowers total system costs relative to wind-solar-battery systems, and that system costs are twice as sensitive to reductions in LDS costs as to reductions in battery costs. In least-cost systems, batteries are used primarily for intra-day storage and LDS is used primarily for inter-season and multi-year storage. Moreover, dependence on LDS increases when the system is optimized over more years. LDS technologies could improve the affordability of renewable electricity.}

  abstract = {Utilities have long struggled with establishing resource planning criteria that ensure adequate resources to meet loads at low cost. Historically, many utilities used planning reserve margin criteria. The onset of deregulation brought about a paradigm shift in which it was expected that markets would provide a more efficient mechanism for maintaining resource sufficiency in the course of system demand growth. Major power shortages in the Midwest and California in the wake of deregulation led to a reexamination by most regions of the need for centralized resource planning and integrated resource plans. Reserve margin techniques continue to be used by many resource planners to ensure resource adequacy. Simulation-based probabilistic assessments can provide a more direct measure of adequacy but are quite intensive computationally and therefore only allow exploring a limited number of scenarios. In this paper, we suggest a simple analytical probabilistic approach to maintaining resource adequacy and calculating peak load carrying capability of incremental generating units. The methodology targets a level of system adequacy, rather than a specified reserve margin, under system expansion. It provides a powerful technique for simply calculating probability-based load carrying capability of resource additions without iteratively running computationally intensive stochastic computer models. The technique also provides a simple but effective method for developing portfolios of resources with comparable contributions to system adequacy. The latter may be employed in capacity expansion algorithms as a simpler, more efficient, and more accurate method of determining least-cost resource additions than targeting planning reserve margins. Applications of these techniques to the IEEE Reliability Test System illustrate the methods and verify the results with a stochastic model.}

  abstract = {The Brazilian electricity system is an important example of a large country relying on a high renewable energy matrix with a major focus on hydropower, which has historically allowed for low carbon electricity production. However, the increase in the demand and climate change impacts on the availability of these renewable resources represent important challenges for long-term power planning. The contribution of this paper is twofold: Firstly, a first attempt to use the EnergyPLAN model for the analysis of the Brazilian electricity sector and in particular to study future scenarios is presented. Secondly, the possibility of achieving a 100\% RES system is also addressed. The 100\% RES scenario is found to be theoretically possible but a substantial increase in the overall installed capacity would be required, to support the grid mainly during the spring and summer season. The results underline the importance of seasonal complementarity of hydro and wind power and reveal how an increase in RES would add exportation potential, reducing also the Brazilian external energy dependency. The study identifies risk factors for these high RES scenarios and outlines several avenues for future research to address cost, environmental and technical uncertainties of the system.}

To this end, a coherent methodology for the assessment of system capacity adequacy and the calculation of energy storage capacity value is presented, utilizing the Monte Carlo technique. The main focus is on short-duration storage, mainly battery energy storage systems (BESS), whose capacity values are determined for different power and energy configurations. Alternative operating policies (OPs) are implemented, prioritizing system cost or reliability, to demonstrate the significant effect storage management may have on its contribution to system adequacy. A medium-sized island system is used as a study case, applying a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) generation scheduling model to simulate BESS and system operation under each OP, in order to determine capacity contribution and overall performance in terms of renewable energy sources (RES) penetration, system operating cost and BESS lifetime expectancy. This study reveals that BESS contribution to system adequacy can be significant (capacity credit values up to {\textasciitilde}85\%), with energy capacity proving to be the most significant parameter. Energy storage may at the same time enhance system reliability, reduce generation cost and support RES integration, provided that it is appropriately managed; a combined reliability-oriented and cost-driven management approach is shown to yield optimal results.},

The wind data sets that serve as inputs into the study must realistically reflect the ramping characteristics, spatial and temporal correlations, and capacity factors of the simulated wind plants, as well as be time synchronized with available load profiles. The Wind Integration National Dataset (WIND) Toolkit described in this article fulfills these requirements as the largest and most complete grid integration data set publicly available to date. A meteorological data set, wind power production time series, and simulated forecasts created using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model run on a 2-km grid over the continental United States at a 5-min resolution is now publicly available for more than 126,000 land-based and offshore wind power production sites. State-of-the-art forecast accuracy was mimicked by reforecasting the years 2007--2013 using industry-standard techniques. Our meteorological and power validation results show that the WIND Toolkit data is satisfactory for wind energy integration studies. Users are encouraged to validate according to their phenomena and application of interest.}

  abstract = {The challenge of stabilizing global carbon emissions over the next 50 years has been framed in the context of finding seven 1.0 Gton C/year carbon reduction wedges. Solar photovoltaics (PV) could provide at least one carbon wedge, but will require significant growth in PV manufacturing capacity. The actual amount of installed PV capacity required to reach wedge-level carbon reductions will vary greatly depending on the mix of avoided fuels and the additional emissions from manufacturing PV capacity. In this work, we find that the US could reduce its carbon emissions by 0.25 Gton C/year, equal to the fraction of a global carbon wedge proportional to its current domestic electricity use, by installing 792-811 GW of PV capacity. We evaluate a series of PV growth scenarios and find that wedge-level reductions could be met by increasing PV manufacturing capacity and annual installations by 0.95 GW/year/year each year from 2009 to 2050 or by increasing up to 4 GW/year/year for a period of 4-17 years for early and late growth scenarios. This challenge of increasing PV manufacturing capacity and market demand is significant but not out of line with the recent rapid growth in both the global and US PV industry. We find that the rapid growth in PV manufacturing capacity leads to a short term increase in carbon emissions from the US electric sector. However, this increase is small, contributing less than an additional 0.3\% to electric sector emissions for less than 4.5 years, alleviating recent concern regarding carbon emissions from rapid PV growth scenarios.},

Here we modelled stylized electricity systems under a least-cost optimization framework taking into account technoeconomic factors only, considering electricity demand and renewable potential in 42 country-level regions. In our model, in moderate decarbonization scenarios, solar and wind can provide less costly electricity when competing against nuclear at near-current US Energy Information Administration (US\$6,317 per kilowatt-electric (kWe)) and at US\$4,000\,kWe-1 cost levels. In contrast, in deeply decarbonized systems (for example, beyond {\textasciitilde}80\% emissions reduction) and in the absence of low-cost grid-flexibility mechanisms, nuclear can be competitive with solar and wind. High-quality wind resources can make it difficult for nuclear to compete. Thermal heat storage coupled to nuclear power can, in some cases, promote wind and solar.},

If, as the theory would suggest, the demand for durables and their use are related decisions by the consumer, specifications which ignore this fact will lead to biased and inconsistent estimates of price and income elasticities. The present paper attempts to test this bias using a subsample of the 1975 survey of 3249 households carried out by the Washington Center for Metropolitan Studies (WCMS) for the Federal Energy Administration. We discuss and derive a unified model of the demand for consumer durables and the derived demand for electricity. To determine the magnitude of the bias resulting from estimating a unit electricity consumption (UEC) equation by ordinary least squares when unobserved factors influence both choice of appliances and intensity of use, we introduce and estimate a joint water-heat space-heat choice model, and conclude with the consistent estimation and specification of demand for electricity equations.]}

We develop a manufacturing cost model to estimate the Nth generation production costs of PCFC stack technology using high volume manufacturing processes and compare them to the state-of-the-art in SOFC technology. The low-cost cell manufacturing enabled by the SSRS technique compensates for the lower PCFC power density and the trade-off between operating temperature and efficiency enables the use of lower-cost stainless steel materials.

  abstract = {While the energy supply of most islands depends mainly on expensive oil derivatives' importation, the others are linked by usually a weak electricity grid connection to the mainland. Due to high energy costs the islands are proving to be excellent test beds for the introduction of new technologies, and some islands are trying to become so-called renewable islands, to satisfy their energy demand mainly or entirely from indigenous and renewable sources, thus increasing the security of supply, and employment opportunities, without necessarily increasing the costs. Islands that have energy sources, such as hydro or geothermal energy, can easily integrate them into the power system, but those with mainly intermittent renewable energy sources are confronted with the necessity of energy storage. The most promising technologies are reversible hydro where geography allows, and storing hydrogen where it does not. The stored hydrogen can later be used for electricity production, and also for transport. This paper describes the H2RES model for optimisation of integration of hydrogen usage with intermittent renewable energy sources on the example of an isolated island in the Madeira archipelago, Porto Santo. It shows that it is possible to significantly increase the penetration of renewable energy sources, albeit at a relatively high cost, with hydrogen storage technology. The H2RES model, which includes reversible hydro and batteries as storage technologies, can serve as a valuable tool for island energy planning.}

Many studies investigate the revenue which could be achieved through arbitrage assuming perfect foresight of electricity prices. In practice, storage operators will not have perfect foresight and will have to devise operational strategies using price forecasts. This paper investigates the impact of forecast accuracy on the optimality of storage revenue. The optimal revenue available is determined using linear programming and historic electricity prices. The results are compared to those found using dynamic programming and electricity price forecasts with increasing percentage error. A small scale lithium ion battery and a large pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) device are compared. The results show that revenue reduces at an increasing rate with increasing forecast error. The PHES device is more sensitive to forecast accuracy than the lithium ion battery. For both technologies, with a maximum error of 30\%, 80\% of the optimal revenue can be achieved. With increased capacity and significantly increased power rating, the lithium ion battery becomes more sensitive to price forecast accuracy.}

The benefits of this modification may include reduced congestion costs, an increased renewable energy penetration rate, and improved network reliability. DLR is already well developed, but few papers in the literature investigate DLR day-ahead forecasting. The latter is central to DLR development since many of the decisions related to grid management are taken at least on a day-ahead basis. In this paper, two problems related to DLR forecasts are dealt with: how to achieve precise, reliable calculations of day-ahead forecasts of overhead line ampacity and how to define a methodology to calculate safe rating values using these forecasts. On the first point, four machine-learning algorithms were evaluated, identifying the best approach for this problem and quantifying the potential performance. On the second point, the developed methodology was tested and compared to the current static line rating approach.},

  abstract = {The need for new sources of renewable energies and the rising price of fossil fuels have induced the hope that agricultural crops may be a source of renewable energy for the future. We question in this paper the best strategies to convert solar radiation into both energy and food. The intrinsic efficiency of the photosynthetic process is quite low (around 3\%) while commercially available monocristalline solar photovoltaic (PV) panels have an average yield of 15\%. Therefore huge arrays of solar panels are now envisaged. Solar plants using PV panels will therefore compete with agriculture for land. In this paper, we suggest that a combination of solar panels and food crops on the same land unit may maximise the land use. We suggest to call this an agrivoltaic system. We used Land Equivalent Ratios to compare conventional options (separation of agriculture and energy harvesting) and two agrivoltaic systems with different densities of PV panels. We modelled the light transmission at the crop level by an array of solar panels and used a crop model to predict the productivity of the partially shaded crops. These preliminary results indicate that agrivoltaic systems may be very efficient: a 35--73\% increase of global land productivity was predicted for the two densities of PV panels. Facilitation mechanisms similar to those evidenced in agroforestry systems may explain the advantage of such mixed systems. New solar plants may therefore combine electricity production with food production, especially in countries where cropping land is scarce. There is a need to validate the hypotheses included in our models and provide a proof of the concept by monitoring prototypes of agrivoltaic systems.}

The MIT (2003) study provided useful data on the cost of then recent builds in Japan and the Republic of Korea. We provide similar data on later builds in Japan and the Republic of Korea as well as a careful analysis of the forecasted costs on some recently proposed plants in the US. Using the updated cost of construction, we calculate a levelized cost of electricity from nuclear power. We also update the cost of electricity from coal- and gas-fired power plants and compare the levelized costs of nuclear, coal and gas. The results show that the cost of constructing a nuclear plant have approximately doubled. The cost of constructing coal-fired plants has also increased, although perhaps just as importantly, the cost of the coal itself spiked dramatically, too. Capital costs are a much smaller fraction of the cost of electricity from gas, so it is the recent spike in the price of natural gas that have contributed to the increased cost of electricity. These results document changing prices leading up to the current economic and financial crisis, and do not incorporate how this crisis may be currently affecting prices.},

It is expected that a decrease in the capital cost of storage will eventually spur the deployment of large amounts of ES. These devices will provide transmission services, such as spatiotemporal energy arbitrage, i.e., storing surplus energy from intermittent renewable sources for later use by loads while reducing the congestion in the transmission network. This paper proposes a bilevel program that determines the optimal location and size of storage devices to perform this spatiotemporal energy arbitrage. This method aims to simultaneously reduce the system-wide operating cost and the cost of investments in ES while ensuring that merchant storage devices collect sufficient profits to fully recover their investment cost. The usefulness of the proposed method is illustrated using a representative case study of the ISO New England system with a prospective wind generation portfolio.}

We investigated the sensitivity of a Western U.S. power system to isolated and combined heat and drought when it has low (5\%) and moderate (31\%) variable renewable energy shares, representing historic and future systems. We used an electricity operational model combined with a model of historically extreme drought (for hydropower and freshwater-reliant thermoelectric generators) over the Western U.S. and a synthetic, regionally extreme heat event in Southern California (for thermoelectric generators and electricity load). We found that the drought has the highest impact on summertime production cost (+10\% to +12\%), while temperature-based deratings have minimal effect (at most +1\%). The Southern California heat wave scenario impacting load increases summertime regional net imports to Southern California by 10--14\%, while the drought decreases them by 6--12\%. Combined heat and drought conditions have a moderate effect on imports to Southern California (-2\%) in the historic system and a stronger effect (+8\%) in the future system. Southern California dependence on other regions decreases in the summertime with the moderate increase in variable renewable energy (-34\% imports), but hourly peak regional imports are maintained under those infrastructure changes. By combining synthetic and historically driven conditions to test two infrastructures, we consolidate the importance of considering compounded heat wave and drought in planning studies and suggest that region-to-region energy transfers during peak periods are key to optimal operations under climate extremes.           ,              Key Points                                                                Contemporary and future Western U.S. power grids are evaluated with stochastic and historically based compound climate extreme scenarios                                                     Drought has most impact on simulated generation mix and production cost; load changes under heat have more impact on regional power flow                                                     Total summer regional power flows decrease in the future power system simulations, but power flows remain critical during peak hours},

We apply linear regression and unsupervised classification methods to hourly, whole-home consumption and outdoor air temperature data to determine the hours, if any, that each home׳s A/C is active, and the temperature dependence of consumption when it is active. When results from our sample are scaled up to the total population, we find a maximum of 270--360 MW (95\% c.i.) of demand response potential over a 1-h duration with a 4 {$^\circ$}F setpoint change, and up to 3.2--3.8 GW of short-term curtailment potential. The estimated resource correlates well with the evening decline of solar production on hot, summer afternoons, suggesting that demand response could potentially act as reserves for the grid during these periods in the near future with expected higher adoption rates of solar energy. Additionally, the top 5\% of homes in the sample represent 40\% of the total MW-hours of DR resource, suggesting that policies and programs to take advantage of this resource should target these high users to maximize cost-effectiveness.}

We observe that nth-of-a-kind plants have been more, not less, expensive than first-of-a-kind plants. ``Soft'' factors external to standardized reactor hardware, such as labor supervision, contributed over half of the cost rise from 1976 to 1987. Relatedly, containment building costs more than doubled from 1976 to 2017, due only in part to safety regulations. Labor productivity in recent plants is up to 13 times lower than industry expectations. Our results point to a gap between expected and realized costs stemming from low resilience to time- and site-dependent construction conditions. Prospective models suggest reducing commodity usage and automating construction to increase resilience. More generally, rethinking engineering design to relate design variables to cost change mechanisms could help deliver real-world cost reductions for technologies with demanding construction requirements.},

First, we explore different social objectives justifying the deployment of RE technologies and review model-based estimates of the economic potential of RE technologies, i.e. their socially optimal deployment level. Second, we address pivotal market failures that arise in the course of implementing the economic potential of RE sources in decentralized markets. Third, we discuss multiple policy instruments curing these market failures. Our framework reveals the requirements for an assessment of the relevant options for real-world decision makers in the field of RE policies.

The objective of this article is to investigate the economic effects of offshore wind on the electricity spot market and thus open up another perspective that has not been part of the debate about offshore vs. onshore wind thus far. A comprehensive assessment based on a large amount of market, feed-in and weather data in Germany revealed that the market value of offshore wind is generally higher than that of onshore wind. Simulating the merit order effect on the German day-ahead electricity market for the short term and long term in the years 2006--2014 aimed to identify the reason for this observation and show whether it is also an indication of a lower impact on the electricity spot market due to a steadier wind resource prevailing offshore. Although the results suggest no difference regarding the impact on market price and value, they indeed reveal that offshore wind imposes less variability on the spot market price than onshore wind. In addition, the long-term simulation proved that the ongoing price deterioration cannot be blamed on the characteristic of variable wind production.}

In this study, renewable energy options including pumped hydro, pressurized air, flywheels, Li ion batteries, hydrogen and super-capacitors are compared based on a specific set of criteria. The criteria considered are energy/power density, ease of integration with the existing energy network, cost effectiveness, durability, efficiency and safety. Our study showed that storing renewable energy sources in the form of hydrogen through the electrolysis process is ranked as the most promising option considering the mentioned criteria. It brings about several benefits suggesting that hydrogen and fuel cells are promising contributors towards a more sustainable future, both in energy demand and environmental sustainability.}

  abstract = {Policy makers face difficult choices in planning to decarbonise their electricity industries in the face of significant technology and economic uncertainties. To this end we compare the projected costs in 2030 of one medium-carbon and two low-carbon fossil fuel scenarios for the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) against the costs of a previously published scenario for 100\% renewable electricity in 2030. The three new fossil fuel scenarios, based on the least cost mix of baseload and peak load power stations in 2010, are: (i) a medium-carbon scenario utilising only gas-fired combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) and open cycle gas turbines (OCGTs); (ii) coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS) plus peak load OCGT; and (iii) gas-fired CCGT with CCS plus peak load OCGT. We perform sensitivity analyses of the results to future carbon prices, gas prices, and CO2 transportation and storage costs which appear likely to be high in most of Australia. We find that only under a few, and seemingly unlikely, combinations of costs can any of the fossil fuel scenarios compete economically with 100\% renewable electricity in a carbon constrained world. Our findings suggest that policies pursuing very high penetrations of renewable electricity based on commercially available technology offer a cost effective and low risk way to dramatically cut emissions in the electricity sector.}

  abstract = {Least cost options are presented for supplying the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) with 100\% renewable electricity using wind, photovoltaics, concentrating solar thermal (CST) with storage, hydroelectricity and biofuelled gas turbines. We use a genetic algorithm and an existing simulation tool to identify the lowest cost (investment and operating) scenarios of renewable technologies and locations for NEM regional hourly demand and observed weather in 2010 using projected technology costs for 2030. These scenarios maintain the NEM reliability standard, limit hydroelectricity generation to available rainfall, and limit bioenergy consumption. The lowest cost scenarios are dominated by wind power, with smaller contributions from photovoltaics and dispatchable generation: CST, hydro and gas turbines. The annual cost of a simplified transmission network to balance supply and demand across NEM regions is a small proportion of the annual cost of the generating system. Annual costs are compared with a scenario where fossil fuelled power stations in the NEM today are replaced with modern fossil substitutes at projected 2030 costs, and a carbon price is paid on all emissions. At moderate carbon prices, which appear required to address climate change, 100\% renewable electricity would be cheaper on an annual basis than the replacement scenario.}

  abstract = {As a part of a program to explore technological options for the transition to a renewable energy future, we present simulations for 100\% renewable energy systems to meet actual hourly electricity demand in the five states and one territory spanned by the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) in 2010. The system is based on commercially available technologies: concentrating solar thermal (CST) power with thermal storage, wind, photovoltaic (PV), existing hydro and biofuelled gas turbines. Hourly solar and wind generation data are derived from satellite observations, weather stations, and actual wind farm outputs. Together CST and PV contribute about half of total annual electrical energy supply. A range of 100\% renewable energy systems for the NEM are found to be technically feasible and meet the NEM reliability standard. The principal challenge is meeting peak demand on winter evenings following overcast days when CST storage is partially charged and sometimes wind speeds are low. The model handles these circumstances by combinations of an increased number of gas turbines and reductions in winter peak demand. There is no need for conventional base-load power plants. The important parameter is the reliability of the whole supply-demand system, not the reliability of particular types of power plants.}

The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) in 2030 is used as a case study for exploring various generation portfolios from low to high shares of RE, low to high greenhouse gas emissions caps, and low to high carbon prices. Incremental costs are found to increase approximately linearly as the RE share grows from zero to 80\%, and then demonstrate a small degree of non-linear escalation, related to the inclusion of more costly renewable technologies such as solar thermal electricity. Similarly, costs increase approximately linearly as a greenhouse gas emissions cap is lowered from 150 megatonnes (Mt) to 30~Mt, and then demonstrate a small degree of non-linear escalation for caps below 30~Mt. However, in both cases this escalation is moderate, and does not appear to provide a strong argument for long-term policies that aim for RE shares lower than 100\%, or electricity sector emissions caps higher than zero as one option for rapid decarbonisation.}

While recent fires afflicting some of these BESS have garnered significant media attention, the overall rate of incidents has sharply decreased, as lessons learned from early failure incidents have been incorporated into new designs and best practices. It is necessary to have a better understanding of the causes of BESS failure. This report utilizes data from EPRI's BESS Failure Incident Database, as well as findings from incident reports, root cause analyses, and expert interviews to develop an aggregate analysis of failure causes. The report found that a significant fraction of BESS failure incidents had an unknown root cause. Of the incidents that were classified, there was no single cause that contributed to a majority of failures. The balance-of-system components and controls were the leading causes of failure, with the cell having a relatively small number of failures attributed to it. The battery industry continues to engage in R\&D activities to improve prevention and mitigation measures, including development of a better understanding of the diverse causes of BESS failures.},

  abstract = {The resource quality and the temporal generation pattern of variable renewable energy sources vary significantly across Europe. In this paper spatial distributions of renewable assets are explored which exploit this heterogeneity to lower the total system costs for a high level of renewable electricity in Europe. Several intuitive heuristic algorithms, optimal portfolio theory and a local search algorithm are used to find optimal distributions of renewable generation capacities that minimise the total costs of backup, transmission and renewable capacity simultaneously. Using current cost projections, an optimal heterogeneous distribution favours onshore wind, particularly in countries bordering the North Sea, which results in average electricity costs that are up to 11\% lower than for a homogeneous reference distribution of renewables proportional to each country's mean load. The reduction becomes even larger, namely 18\%, once the transmission capacities are put to zero in the homogeneous reference distribution. Heuristic algorithms to distribute renewable capacity based on each country's wind and solar capacity factors are shown to provide a satisfactory approximation to fully optimised renewable distributions, while maintaining the benefits of transparency and comprehensibility. The sensitivities of the results to changing costs of solar generation and gas supply as well as to the possible cross-sectoral usage of unavoidable curtailment energy are also examined.}

  abstract = {Hydrogen holds tremendous potential to decarbonize many economic sectors, from chemical and material industries to energy storage and generation. However, hydrogen is a tiny, leak-prone molecule that can indirectly warm the climate. Thus, hydrogen emissions from its value chain (production, conversion, transportation/distribution, storage, and end-use) could considerably undermine the anticipated climate benefits of a hydrogen economy. Several studies have identified value chain components that may intentionally and/or unintentionally emit hydrogen. However, the amount of hydrogen emitted from infrastructure is unknown as emissions have not yet been empirically quantified. Without the capacity to make accurate direct measurements, over the past two decades, some studies have attempted to estimate total value chain and component-level hydrogen emissions using various approaches, e.g., assumptions, calculations via proxies, laboratory experiments, and theory-based models (simulations). Here, we synthesize these studies to provide an overview of the available knowledge on hydrogen emissions across value chains. Briefly, the largest ranges in estimated emissions rates are associated with liquefaction (0.15\%--10\%), liquid hydrogen transporting and handling (2\%--20\%), and liquid hydrogen refueling (2\%--15\%). Moreover, present and future value chain emission rate estimates vary widely (0.2\%--20\%). Field measurements of hydrogen emissions throughout the value chain are critically needed to sharpen our understanding of hydrogen emissions and, with them, accurately assess the climate impact of hydrogen deployment.},

The present paper proposes a method to estimate the required amount of storage backup for a mostly solar and wind system that uses also biomass and hydroenergy as minor components of the electricity mix. An hourly simulation was carried out to determine the amount of electricity that could be produced based on the meteorological conditions of year 2001 in Japan, and this was compared with the maximum electricity demands imposed in the system for each month of the year. The system thus proposed has 100\% chance of meeting around 40\% of the electricity demand between 11:00 and 18:00, and the optimum scenario obtained (a 2:1 mix of solar to wind energy) required around 40TW of storage to balance the extra electricity demand that occurs during the summer in Japan. It appears unlikely that the batteries in EV in vehicles will be able to meet this storage requirement in the future, though the system is able to adequately meet the electricity demand during the majority of the year, and hence showcases the viability of renewable energy.}

The assessment is based on a simulation of the hourly future electricity production based on wind and solar meteorological data, that can cope with the estimated future hourly electricity demand in Japan for the year 2030. Such as system would use pump-up storage and electric batteries to balance the daily fluctuations in supply and demand, though the most important challenge of the system would be providing sufficient electricity to meet the summer demand peak. These findings have import implications at the policy making level, as it shows that the Japanese electricity generation system is technically able to increase the share of renewables up to 100\%, guaranteeing a stable and reliable supply.}

However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.}

The purpose of this paper is to ensure an optimal power splitting between the fuel cell system (FCS) and the battery pack, taking into account the operating conditions of the FCS. The FCS is a multi-physics system, and consequently, its energetic performances depend on the operating conditions (i.e., temperature, gas relative humidity, gas stoichiometry, pressure and ageing). Specific techniques must be used to reach the best performances of the FCS. In this work, models are identified online by using the adaptive recursive least square (ARLS) method to seek a variation in the FCS performances. Then, an optimization algorithm is used on the updated model to find the best efficiency and power operating points. This process is used into an optimal EMS based on Pontryagin's minimum principle, for a FC-HEV. The effectiveness of the proposed EMS is demonstrated by conducting studies on two FCSs with different levels of degradation.}

We outline a method to construct country-level wind resource supply curves, delineated by resource quality and other parameters. Using mesoscale reanalysis data, we generate estimates for wind quality, both terrestrial and offshore, across the globe. Because not all land or water area is suitable for development, appropriate database layers provide exclusions to reduce the total resource to its technical potential. We expand upon estimates from related studies by: using a globally consistent data source of uniquely detailed wind speed characterizations; assuming a non-constant coefficient of performance for adjusting power curves for altitude; categorizing the distance from resource sites to the electric power grid; and characterizing offshore exclusions on the basis of sea ice concentrations. The product, then, is technical potential by country, classified by resource quality as determined by net capacity factor. Additional classifications dimensions are available, including distance to transmission networks for terrestrial wind and distance to shore and water depth for offshore. We estimate the total global wind generation potential of 560 PWh for terrestrial wind with 90\% of resource classified as low-to-mid quality, and 315 PWh for offshore wind with 67\% classified as mid-to-high quality. These estimates are based on 3.5MW composite wind turbines with 90m hub heights, 0.95 availability, 90\% array efficiency, and 5MW/km2 deployment density in non-excluded areas. We compare the underlying technical assumption and results with other global assessments.}

  abstract = {Recent technology cost and performance improvements and the federal investment tax credit (ITC) have driven growing interest in coupling solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery systems. Combining these technologies into co-located or hybridized PV+battery systems has the potential to lower costs and increase energy output relative to multiple independent systems. In this work, we provide an overview of PV+battery systems and demonstrate methods for incorporating them into NREL's Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) capacity expansion model. Although the methods are applied to a specific model, we anticipate that the approaches used here can be useful for informing PV+battery method development for other capacity expansion models. The implemented method relies heavily on the native representations of PV and battery technologies; therefore, the focus of this work is on capturing and parameterizing the interactions between them for a configuration in which the PV and battery technologies share a single bi-directional inverter. This work also demonstrates the impacts of including PV+battery systems in the ReEDS optimization for the conterminous United States through 2050. In particular, we perform parametric sensitivities for input assumptions that are uncertain and expected to influence PV+battery deployment levels, including (a) the cost of PV+battery systems relative to independent PV and battery systems, (b) the battery component's qualification for the ITC, and (c) future cost trajectories for PV and battery systems. We find that PV+battery deployment could occur throughout the conterminous United States if there are cost savings associated with DC coupling PV and battery technologies. If even modest (5\%) cost savings can be achieved (through a shared inverter and balance-of-system costs), then approximately one-third of utility-scale PV deployment through 2050 adopts the DC-coupled hybrid configuration, resulting in total PV+battery deployment that exceeds the magnitude of PV+battery projects in U.S. interconnection queues in 2020. If greater cost savings can be achieved through DC coupling (e.g., due to a growing amount of shared balance-of-system costs, reduced financial risk, or modularity) or more rapid cost and performance improvements are realized for PV and battery technologies, then total PV+battery deployment and the share of PV and battery deployment that adopts the hybrid configuration grows (to {$>$}50\%). In all cases, growing PV+battery deployment primarily displaces independent PV and battery technologies, indicating the strong competition between the hybrid and independent configurations comprising technologies with similar performance characteristics.},

The major constraints for increasing penetration of renewable energy sources is their availability and intermittency, which can be addressed through energy storage when available and energy use when needed. This work reviews the energy storage technologies and gives an up to date comparative summary of the performance parameters of the major energy storage options. The parameters compared here include efficiency, energy capacity, energy density, run time, capital investment costs, response time, lifetime in years and cycles, self discharge and maturity of each energy storage option. The choice of storage system will depend on individual requirements, and may even incorporate more than one energy storage system to increase the energy storage capacity and improve energy security.}

There is a steady increase in usage of hybrid renewable energy units and consequently optimization problem solving for this system is a necessity. In recent years, researchers are interested in using multi-objective optimization methods for this issue. Therefore, in the present study, an overview of applied multi-objective methods by using evolutionary algorithms for hybrid renewable energy systems was proposed to help the present and future research works. The result shows that there are a few studies about optimization of many objects in a hybrid system by these algorithms and the most popular applied methods are genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization.}

  abstract = {Most studies of near-zero-carbon power systems consider Europe and the United States. In this paper, we focus on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), where weather conditions, especially for solar, differ substantially from those in Europe. We use a green-field linear capacity expansion model with over-night investment to assess the effect on system cost of (i) limiting/expanding the amount of land available for wind and solar farms, (ii) allowing for nuclear power and (iii) disallowing for international transmission. This is done under three different cost regimes for solar PV and battery storage. We find that:   - The amount of available land for wind and solar farms can have a great impact on the system cost. We found a cost increase of 0-50\% as a result of reduced available land. In MENA, the impact on system cost is greatly influenced by the PV and battery cost regime, which is not the case in Europe.   - Allowing for nuclear has nearly no effect in MENA, while it can decrease system costs in Europe by up to 23\%. In Europe, the effect on system cost of whether nuclear power is allowed is highly dependent on the PV and battery cost regime, which is not the case in MENA.   - Disallowing for international transmission increases costs by up to around 25\% in both Europe and MENA. The cost increase depends on cost regime for PV and batteries.   The impact on system cost off these three controversial parts of a decarbonized power system thus plays out differently, depending on (i) the region and (ii) uncertain future costs for solar PV and storage. We conclude that a renewable power system in MENA, is less costly than in Europe irrespective of the cost regime. In MENA, the system costs vary between 37 and 83 euro/MWh. In Europe, the system costs vary between 43 and 89 euro/MWh.},

We analyze data reported to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) from 1994 to 2014 using linear regression to understand how the number of customers in a utility's territory, annual peak demand, and annual energy sales affect annual TD\&A spending. Then, we use Edison Electric Institute data for 1960 to 1992 to show trends in TD\&A spending between 1960 and 2014. We find that the number of customers in a utility's territory is the single best predictor for annual TD\&A costs. Between 1994 and 2014, the average cost per customer was 119/Customer-Year for transmission, 291/Customer-Year for distribution, and 333/Customer-Year for utility administration. Total TD\&A costs per customer have been approximately 700--\$800/Customer-Year since 1960, but the cost per kWh of energy sold was significantly higher in the 1960s because the average customer used less than half as much energy annually versus 2014. Thus, TD\&A costs per kWh are likely to increase if kWh energy sales decline in the future unless cost recovery is transitioned to a mechanism not based solely on kWh sales.}

  abstract = {CO2 direct air capture (DAC) has been increasingly discussed as a climate change mitigation option. Despite technical advances in the past decade, there are still misconceptions about DAC's current and long-term costs as well as energy, water and area demands. This could undermine DAC's anticipated role in a neutral or negative greenhouse gas emission energy system, and influence policy makers. In this study, a literature review and techno-economic analyses of state-of-the-art DAC technologies are performed, wherein, DAC technologies are categorised as high temperature aqueous solutions (HT DAC) and low temperature solid sorbent (LT DAC) systems, from an energy system perspective. DAC capital expenditures, energy demands and costs have been estimated under two scenarios for DAC capacities and financial learning rates in the period 2020 to 2050. DAC system costs could be lowered significantly with commercialisation in the 2020s followed by massive implementation in the 2040s and 2050s, making them cost competitive with point source carbon capture and an affordable climate change mitigation solution. It is concluded that LT DAC systems are favourable due to lower heat supply costs and the possibility of using waste heat from other systems. CO2 capture costs of LT DAC systems powered by hybrid PV-Wind-battery systems for Moroccan conditions and based on a conservative scenario, without/with utilisation of free waste heat are calculated at 222/133, 105/60, 69/40 and 54/32 {\texteuro}/tCO2 in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050, respectively. These new findings could enhance DAC's role in a successful climate change mitigation strategy.}

  abstract = {The penetration of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation is increasing in many countries, with significant implications for the adequacy and operation of power systems. This work considers the Nord bidding zone within Italy, which hosts 7.7~GW of PV and almost no wind power. We simulate the implications of different PV penetration levels on the need for firm generation capacity and on ramping requirements over one to several hours. We compare ten years of synthetic hourly PV generation series derived from CM-SAF SARAH satellite data and observed load. The analysis also provides insights into the storage capacity required to smooth residual load over different time horizons. Results show that without storage (i) the penetration of PV in the region does not sensibly reduce the need for firm generation; (ii) the marginal contribution of PV to meet power demand decreases with its penetration; and (iii) high penetrations lead to larger and more frequent ramps, although extreme ramp rates do not last more than 1~h. The availability of storage significantly alters these results, but large storage capacities are required. Smoothing net load by a few hours requires 2--7 GWh of storage per GW of PV installed.}

  abstract = {The growing concerns about climate change and security of supply opened way to a significant investment in the exploitation of RES (renewable energy sources) for electricity generation. The possibility of achieving 100\% RES systems is being debated but concerns about costs, storage and backup capacity still prevail. This paper addresses the topic of renewable energy scenarios for the electricity sector, analyzing different possible future strategies for the Portuguese system. Each one of these strategies is characterized according to the expected electricity consumption and renewable share, with the final aim of analyzing a possible 100\% RES scenario. The energy system analysis tool EnergyPLAN was used for simulating each scenario for a~one year period. The 100\% RES scenario is found to be theoretically possible but a significant increase on the total capacity of the system would be necessary to ensure no shortfall during the summer season. The outcome would be the existence of critical excess electricity production during the winter and also a significant increase of the total cost of the system. The importance of the interconnection as stabilization measure along with the inclusion of storage systems is discussed for a system highly dependent on renewable energy sources.}

New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength {\textohm} becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system {$\omega$}. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large {\textohm}/{$\omega$}c = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling {\textohm} {$\propto$} {\textsurd}n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 {\texttimes} 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few ({$<$};100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled ({\textohm}/{$\omega$}- {\textbar}{\textbar}}

Many renewable sources, most notably wind and to some extent solar, are variable in their nature and present a new set of challenges in integrating them on the power grid. The policies to integrate these resources are often implemented at the balancing authority level and include, but are not limited to, the implementation of subhourly markets, increased ancillary or midterm capacity markets for ``fast ramp'' capacity, and energy imbalance markets to allow cross-region transmission to accommodate the variable power.},

  abstract = {The global drive for integration of RESs (renewable energy sources) means they will have an increasing role in power systems. It is inevitable that such resources introduce more operational variability and uncertainty to system functioning because of their intermittent nature. As a result, uncertainty management becomes a critical issue in long-term TEP (Transmission Expansion Planning) in power systems which feature a significant share of renewable power generation, especially in terms of computational requirements. A significant part of this uncertainty is often handled by a set of operational states, here referred to as ``snapshots''. Snapshots are generationddemand patterns that lead to OPF (optimal power flow) patterns in the network. A set of snapshots, each one with an estimated probability, is then used in network expansion optimization. In long-term TEP of large networks, the amount of operational states must be reduced to make the problem computationally tractable. This paper shows how representative snapshots can be selected by means of clustering, without relevant loss of accuracy in a TEP context, when appropriate classification variables are used for the clustering process. The approach relies on two ideas. First, snapshots are characterized by their OPF patterns instead of generationddemand patterns. This is simply because network expansion is the target problem, and losses and congestions are the drivers of network investments. Second, OPF patterns are classified using a ``moments'' technique, a wellknown approach to address Optical Pattern Recognition problems. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the benefits of the proposed clustering methodology. The method seems to be very promising in terms of clustering efficiency and accuracy of the TEP solutions.},

  abstract = {The spatial resolution of energy system optimisation models (ESOMs) is often compromised for computational performance. Reducing the spatial resolution impacts the least-cost solutions when optimising the generation capacity and transmission capacity of the ESOMs with high penetration of variable renewable energy sources. Previous studies show that the two main effects of spatial resolution reduction are the increase in solar and wind expansion capacity and the decrease in transmission capacity expansion. This paper introduces a targeted method of defining regions during spatial scale reduction by using the max-p-regions clustering algorithm to aggregate similar areas into regions. The attributes used to determine the similarity between areas in the max-p-regions method are population; wind and solar resource potential; and pumped-hydro storage capacity. Two alternative spatial resolution reduction methods were used to compare how the effects of spatial resolution impacted the optimisation results of the ESOMs. Evaluation results for three country groups showed that using the max-p-regions method to define regions caused the two effects of spatial resolution reduction to be generally lower than using national jurisdictions. For the case studies Germany and Spain, the results showed that the max-p-regions method identified sets of regions, which were less impacted by the two effects of spatial resolution reduction.}

To achieve this, expansion models will need to incorporate unit commitment constraints, which can result in large scale MILP problems that require significant computational resources to be solved. In this context, this paper proposes a novel Dantzig--Wolfe decomposition and a column generation approach to reduce the computational burden and overcome intractability. We demonstrate through multiple case studies that the proposed approach outperforms direct application of commercial solvers, significantly reducing both computational times and memory usage. Using the Chilean power system as a reference case, we also confirm and highlight the importance of considering unit commitment constraints in generation expansion models.}

This will show where limits in global resources are met and where limits in the data fed to the model until now are met. Results from the modelling are global and regional energy consumption, emission of greenhouse gasses and thereby potential increase in global mean temperature. Furthermore, total system costs are compared to a reference scenario. Existing analysis with TIAM shows different ways of reaching the 2{$^\circ$}C target (increase in global mean temperature) and also how uncertainty on different factors influences the optimal solution. The main conclusion from existing analysis with TIAM is that the 2{$^\circ$}C target is possible to reach, but it will be expensive. Another very important point is that if uncertainty on the value of the climate sensitivity (Cs) is taken into account then the optimal strategy calls for early action compared to a full foresight optimisation using the most probable value of Cs.}

This paper sheds additional light on public response to the scale of energy development by focusing on a dispute that involved a renewable energy technology --- a 25 MW wood-fired electric power plant (WFPP) to have been sited in the remote nonmetropolitan community of Hersey, Michigan. Following a summary of the two year (1978--1980) controversy, facts/values are analyzed relative to the social and political impact of technical expertise. The method entailed a content analysis of the site hearing and accounts in the county weekly newspaper. Findings include a shift toward value issues when experts disagree. Implications are discussed for consumer behavior and energy policy in connection with the scale of renewable energy development, the concomitant distribution of social costs, and the use of expertise to depoliticize issues.},

  abstract = {In electricity markets around the world, the substantial increase of intermittent renewable electricity generation has intensified concerns about generation adequacy, ultimately driving the implementation of capacity remuneration mechanisms. Although formally technology-neutral, substantial barriers often exist in these mechanisms for non-conventional capacity such as electricity storage. In this article, we provide a rigorous theoretical discussion on design parameters and show that the concrete design of a capacity remuneration mechanism always creates a bias towards one technology or the other. In particular, we can identify the bundling of capacity auctions with call options and the definition of the storage capacity credit as essential drivers affecting the future technology mix as well as generation adequacy. In order to illustrate and confirm our theoretical findings, we apply an agent-based electricity market model and run a number of simulations. Our results show that electricity storage has a capacity value and should therefore be allowed to participate in any capacity remuneration mechanism. Moreover, we find the implementation of a capacity remuneration mechanism with call options and a strike price to increase the competitiveness of storages against conventional power plants. However, determining the amount of firm capacity an electricity storage unit can provide remains a challenging task.}

In response to the order, each market operator specified a minimum duration for storage resources to meet or exceed to qualify as peaking capacity. In this work, we assess the impacts of minimum storage duration requirements on energy storage buildout and system operation through 2050 in the United States electricity grid. We also investigate the role that future capital cost reductions play in energy storage deployment in the United States. We use a national-scale capacity expansion model and allow the model to choose from a suite of competing technologies, including battery storage devices of various durations as it builds out a least-cost system. We consider scenarios different minimum storage durations and storage cost projections. We find there is substantial economic potential -- greater than 100 GW in some cases -- for storage with durations of ten hours or less to provide peaking capacity in the United States. We also find that storage deployment is sensitive to minimum storage duration requirements. Longer requirements reduce the amount of storage deployed. Shorter requirements lead to more deployment, but if they are not adjusted to account for the declining capacity credit of storage, there is greater risk for instances of unserved energy. Our results indicate that the design and implementation of duration requirements can have substantial impacts on storage deployment and broader system reliability.},

A linear programming model -- POWER (Power system Optimization With diverse Energy Resources) -- is constructed and used to (1) quantify flexibility cost-benefits of geographic aggregation, renewable overgeneration, storage, and flexible electric vehicle charging, and (2) compare pathways to a fully renewable electricity system. Geographic aggregation provides the largest flexibility benefit with {$\sim$}5--50\% cost savings, but each region's contribution to the aggregate RPS (renewable portfolio standard) target is disproportionate, suggesting the need for regional-and-resource-specific RPS targets. Electric vehicle charging yields a lower levelized system cost, revealing the benefits of demand-side flexibility. However, existing demand response price structures may need adjustment to encourage optimal flexible load in highly renewable systems. Two scenarios with RPS targets from 20\% to 100\% for the US (peak load {$\sim$}729~GW) and California (peak load {$\sim$}62~GW) find each RPS target feasible from a planning perspective, but with 2{\texttimes} the cost and 3{\texttimes} the overgeneration at a 100\% versus 80\% RPS target. Emission reduction cost savings for the aggregated US system with an 80\% versus 20\% RPS target are roughly \$200 billion/year, outweighing the \$80 billion/year cost for the same RPS range.}

This study examines empirically various temporal and spatial tradeoffs using the POWER planning model for scenarios of a highly renewable US system. First, the common temporal simplification of using a representative subset of hours from a full year of available hours is justified using a reduced form model. Accuracy losses are generally {$\leq$}6\%, but storage is sensitive to the associated model modifications, highlighting the need for proper storage balancing constraints. Cost tradeoffs of various temporal and spatial adjustments are then quantified: four temporal resolutions (1- to 8-h-average time blocks); various representative day subset sizes (1 week--6 months); two spatial resolutions of site-by-site versus uniform fractional buildout across all solar and wind sites; and multiple spatial extents, ranging from California to the contiguous US. Most tradeoffs yield {$<$}15\% cost differences, with the effect of geographic aggregation across increasing spatial extents producing the largest cost reduction of 14\% and 42\% for the western and contiguous US, respectively. These results can help power system modelers determine the most appropriate temporal and spatial treatment for their application.}

  abstract = {Modeling the optimal design of the future European energy system involves large data volumes and many mathematical constraints, typically resulting in a significant computational burden. As a result, modelers often apply reductions to their model that can have a significant effect on the accuracy of their results. This study investigates methods for spatially clustering electricity system models at transmission level to overcome the computational constraints. Spatial reduction has a strong effect both on flows in the electricity transmission network and on the way wind and solar generators are aggregated. Clustering methods applied in the literature are typically oriented either towards preserving network flows or towards preserving the properties of renewables, but both are important for future energy systems. In this work we adapt clustering algorithms to accurately represent both networks and renewables. To this end we focus on hierarchical clustering, since it preserves the topology of the transmission system. We test improvements to the similarity metrics used in the clustering by evaluating the resulting regions with measures on renewable feed-in and electrical distance between nodes. Then, the models are optimised under a brownfield capacity expansion for the European electricity system for varying spatial resolutions and renewable penetration. Results are compared to each other and to existing clustering approaches in the literature and evaluated on the preciseness of siting renewable capacity and the estimation of power flows. We find that any of the considered methods perform better than the commonly used approach of clustering by country boundaries and that any of the hierarchical methods yield better estimates than the established method of clustering with k-means on the coordinates of the network with respect to the studied parameters.}

  abstract = {Spatially highly-resolved capacity expansion models are often simplified to a lower spatial resolution because they are computationally intensive. The simplification mixes sites with different renewable features while ignoring transmission lines that can cause congestion. As a consequence, the results may represent an infeasible system when the capacities are fed back at higher spatial detail. Thus far there has been no detailed investigation of how to disaggregate results and whether the spatially highly-resolved disaggregated model is feasible. This is challenging since there is no unique way to invert the clustering. This article is split into two parts to tackle these challenges. First, methods to disaggregate spatially low-resolved results are presented: (a) an uniform distribution of regional results across its original highly-resolved regions, (b) a re-optimisation for each region separately, (c) an approach that minimises the ``excess electricity''. Second, the resulting highly-resolved models' feasibility is investigated by running an operational dispatch. While re-optimising yields the best results, the third inverse method provides comparable results for less computational effort. Feasibility-wise, the study design strengthens that modelling countries by single regions is insufficient. State-of-the-art reduced models with 100--200 regions for Europe still yield 3\%--7\% of load-shedding, depending on model resolution and inverse method.}

  abstract = {Energy system modellers typically choose a low spatial resolution for their models based on administrative boundaries such as countries, which eases data collection and reduces computation times. However, a low spatial resolution can lead to sub-optimal investment decisions for wind and solar generation. Ignoring power grid bottlenecks within regions tends to underestimate system costs, while combining locations with different wind and solar capacity factors in the same resource class tends to overestimate costs. We investigate these two competing effects in a capacity expansion model for Europe's power system with a high share of renewables, taking advantage of newly-available high-resolution datasets as well as computational advances. We vary the number of nodes, interpolating between a 37-node model based on country and synchronous zone boundaries, and a 1024-node model based on the location of electricity substations. If we focus on the effect of renewable resource resolution and ignore network restrictions, we find that a higher resolution allows the optimal solution to concentrate wind and solar capacity at sites with better capacity factors and thus reduces system costs by up to 10\% compared to a low resolution model. This results in a big swing from offshore to onshore wind investment. However, if we introduce grid bottlenecks by raising the network resolution, costs increase by up to 23\% as generation has to be sourced more locally at sites with worse capacity factors. These effects are most pronounced in scenarios where grid expansion is limited, for example, by low local acceptance. We show that allowing grid expansion mitigates some of the effects of the low grid resolution, and lowers overall costs by around 16\%.},

Information from multiple sources shows that during the October 29, 2012 hurricane Sandy, virtually all PV systems received no damage by the storm and, if not disconnected, they produced electricity following the storm. The same was observed in previous disasters. In the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, PV systems were used to support the Gulf States' disaster response efforts. The Fukushima earthquake and tsunami destroyed three nuclear reactors causing ``meltdown'' and radiation releases, whereas the many thousands of PV roof-top arrays were left undamaged. These experiences show that PV systems, in addition to being environmentally benign, can also sustain extreme weather conditions like hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis.}

  abstract = {So far, solar energy has been viewed as only a minor contributor in the energy mixture of the US due to cost and intermittency constraints. However, recent drastic cost reductions in the production of photovoltaics (PV) pave the way for enabling this technology to become cost competitive with fossil fuel energy generation. We show that with the right incentives, cost competitiveness with grid prices in the US (e.g., 6--10US¢/kWh) can be attained by 2020. The intermittency problem is solved by integrating PV with compressed air energy storage (CAES) and by extending the thermal storage capability in concentrated solar power (CSP). We used hourly load data for the entire US and 45-year solar irradiation data from the southwest region of the US, to simulate the CAES storage requirements, under worst weather conditions. Based on expected improvements of established, commercially available PV, CSP, and CAES technologies, we show that solar energy has the technical, geographical, and economic potential to supply 69\% of the total electricity needs and 35\% of the total (electricity and fuel) energy needs of the US by 2050. When we extend our scenario to 2100, solar energy supplies over 90\%, and together with other renewables, 100\% of the total US energy demand with a corresponding 92\% reduction in energy-related carbon dioxide emissions compared to the 2005 levels.}

  abstract = {Increasing penetration of residential photovoltaic (PV) systems has intensified concerns over the related impacts on utility revenue and the equity of deployment subsidies. Community solar (CS) has surfaced as an alternative deployment model for PV that could potentially mitigate these concerns, while integrating distributed solar PV. Given the potential that CS holds in stabilizing the customer-utility relationship amid deeper penetration of distributed solar, in this paper we combine four complementary datasets to analyze how policy, regulatory, and market factors impact the deployment of CS. Specifically, we present a detailed assessment of CS deployment in the United States, including pertinent insights relating to nameplate capacity, billing models, propensities of off-taker utilities to adopt different types of CS, and local market and policy drivers. We find that accounting for both underlying demand and policy/regulatory conditions is essential for understanding the nuanced connections between utility strategy and CS adoption. A particularly interesting finding, stemming consistently across the multiple data streams we analyze, is that utilities are motivated to develop CS not only to satisfy consumer demand or regulatory requirements for renewable energy, but also to alleviate revenue losses related to residential solar PV.}

  abstract = {Optimal design and operation of multi-energy systems involving seasonal energy storage are often hindered by the complexity of the optimization problem. Indeed, the description of seasonal cycles requires a year-long time horizon, while the system operation calls for hourly resolution; this turns into a large number of decision variables, including binary variables, when large systems are analyzed. This work presents novel mixed integer linear program methodologies that allow considering a year time horizon with hour resolution while significantly reducing the complexity of the optimization problem. First, the validity of the proposed techniques is tested by considering a simple system that can be solved in a reasonable computational time without resorting to design days. Findings show that the results of the proposed approaches are in good agreement with the full-scale optimization, thus allowing to correctly size the energy storage and to operate the system with a long-term policy, while significantly simplifying the optimization problem. Furthermore, the developed methodology is adopted to design a multi-energy system based on a neighborhood in Zurich, Switzerland, which is optimized in terms of total annual costs and carbon dioxide emissions. Finally the system behavior is revealed by performing a sensitivity analysis on different features of the energy system and by looking at the topology of the energy hub along the Pareto sets.},

In fact, renewable energy integration is occurring at a massive scale, and several other exciting developments are finding their place in modern energy systems, such as distributed energy resources, demand response, energy storage technologies, and local energy markets. In this dynamic context, the process of energy policy design and implementation has found new challenges, and in supporting this key process, expansion planning models and tools can play an essential role. For example, these models can be employed to estimate the impact of a multitude of policy instruments. Thus, there is a wide interest in these tools and a variety of such models, as evidenced by a rich literature and a fast-paced evolution of this research area. Motivated by this, this work presents a comprehensive and up-to-date review on expansion planning models and tools with emphasis on their application to energy policy analysis. In particular, this paper reviews the most significant policy instruments, with an emphasis in renewable energy integration, the optimization models that have been developed for expansion planning, and existing decision-support tools for energy policy analysis. Finally, this paper also discusses the trends in the literature and the most pressing current challenges in the development and use of expansion planning models for energy policy analysis.}

  abstract = {Studies quantifying the air quality and associated human health ``co-benefits'' from climate mitigation strategies represent a growing area of research and policy analysis. Still, these studies are relatively sparse, reflecting the historical disconnect between literature quantifying the air quality and health, as compared to other aspects of climate and energy policy evaluation. While linkages between energy and transportation sector decarbonization and air pollution are qualitatively well established, quantifying the air quality co-benefits of climate, clean energy, and transportation electrification policies requires models and analysis methods that span social, physical, chemical, and biological systems. Studies in the peer-reviewed literature (n=32) have evaluated carbon pricing, renewable portfolio standards, energy efficiency, renewable energy deployment, and clean transportation. A number of major findings have emerged from these studies: 1) decarbonization strategies can reduce air pollution disproportionally on the most polluted days; 2) renewable energy deployment and climate policies offer the highest health and economic benefits in regions with greater reliance on coal generation; 3) monetized air quality health co-benefits can offset costs of climate policy implementation; 4) monetized co-benefits typically exceed the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of renewable energies; 5) climate mitigation strategies can have adverse effects on air quality; 6) Electric vehicle (EV) adoption generally improves air quality on peak pollution days, but can result in ozone disbenefits in urban centers due to the titration of ozone with nitrogen oxides. Drawing from these published studies, we review the state of knowledge on climate co-benefits to air quality and health, identifying opportunities for policy action and further research.},

The first is the sensitivity to using hourly averaged as opposed to subhourly solar-insolation data. The second is the sensitivity to errors in recording and interpreting load data. The third is the sensitivity to using modeled as opposed to measured solar-insolation data. We demonstrate that capacity-value estimates of solar are sensitive to all three of these factors, with potentially large errors in the capacity-value estimate in a particular year. If multiple years of data are available, the biases introduced by using hourly averaged solar-insolation can be smoothed out. Multiple years of data will not necessarily address the other data-related issues that we examine. Our analysis calls into question the accuracy of a number of solar capacity-value estimates relying exclusively on modeled solar-insolation data that are reported in the literature (including our own previous works). Our analysis also suggests that multiple years' historical data should be used for remunerating solar generators for their capacity value in organized wholesale electricity markets.}

The drawback of these systems is they are less reliable as the generated power depends on meteorological conditions. A properly designed hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) that combines two or more renewable energy sources like wind turbine and solar system with battery back-up increases the reliability of these systems in standalone mode. Hence, the incorporation and collective utilization of renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly popular fields of research. A comprehensive review of various aspects of a HRES is presented in this chapter. This chapter discusses different methodologies available in the literature on feasibility analysis, optimum sizing, modelling, control aspects, and reliability issues of the HRES.},

  abstract = {The selection of the social discount rate and the consideration of hurdle rates in energy systems optimisation models affect the creation of sound and comprehensive scenarios useful for energy modellers. Due to the lack of studies about the use of different discounting options in energy optimisation models, the goal of this paper is to fill that gap by establishing the foundations for a debate among energy modellers, policy-makers and stakeholders in this regard. So firstly, we introduced the concept of discount rates both social and technology-specific including a thorough literature review concerning figures, scopes and approaches. Secondly, two models, ETSAP-TIAM and TIMES-Norway, were used to assess the behaviour of the energy systems at different regionalisation levels, Europe and Norway respectively. Thirdly, we analysed the evolution of the electricity production mixes and system costs for both models and considering several values for the discount rates. Finally, results showed that the energy system is strongly affected by changes in the social discount rate. The lower the social discount rate is, the higher the renewable contribution. The social discounting exerts influence on capital intensive investments so it is quite important to look at the energy carriers pathways (fossil-renewable transition). This is what happens in the case of ETSAP-TIAM for Europe. Reversely, in the case of TIMES-Norway, as the electricity system is almost 100\% renewable, it is important to take into account the hurdle rates of the technologies to enrich the competition by including their particular risks and barriers. In summary, we recommend using a value not higher than 4--5\% for the social discount rate for the European countries as well as to include an exhaustive portfolio of hurdle rates for all the technologies included in the energy optimisation model.}

In this work we enhance a national-scale capacity expansion model to evaluate how PV, wind, and storage interact in the evolution of the power system. Importantly, the modeling framework captures interactions in both investments and operations. Through this work we identify significant synergies between PV and storage. Scenarios with more PV always have more storage, and scenarios with more storage always have more PV. This synergy is due to the diurnal alignment of PV generation with 4-8 hour storage, and to the ability of PV to narrow system peaks to allow shorter-duration storage to serve as a peaking resource. Interactions between wind and storage are less pronounced, though we do observe that longer-duration storage resources appear to provide greater value for wind.}

The markets in North America, Europe and Asia are not integrated, which indicates that a unified global natural gas market has not yet been formed. However, the degree of integration between the European and Asian markets is relative strong during 2000--2011. Finally, the integration among international natural gas markets and the inter-regional LNG trades are highly interrelated and mutually influencing.}

In building codes, practitioners should be aware of emerging tools like building energy performance standards, natural gas bans, net zero requirements, and electrification incentives.

  abstract = {The electrical frequency of an interconnection must be maintained very close to its nominal level at all times. Excessive frequency deviations can lead to load shedding, instability, machine damage, and even blackouts. There is rising concern in the power industry in recent years about the declining amount of inertia and primary frequency response (PFR) in many interconnections. This decline may continue due to increasing penetrations of inverter-coupled generation and the planned retirements of conventional thermal plants. Inverter-coupled variable wind generation is capable of contributing to PFR and inertia; however, wind generation PFR and inertia responses differ from those of conventional generators, and it is not entirely understood how this will affect the system at different wind power penetration levels. The simulation work presented in this paper evaluates the impact of the wind generation provision of these active power control strategies on a large, synchronous interconnection. All simulations were conducted on the U.S. Western Interconnection with different levels of wind power penetration levels. The ability of wind power plants to provide PFRand a combination of synthetic inertial response and PFRsignificantly improved the frequency response performance of the system. The simulation results provide insight to designing and operating wind generation active power controls to facilitate adequate frequency response performance of an interconnection.}

An hourly resolved model is simulated to investigate the total power capacity required from 2015 to 2050 in 5-year time steps to fulfil the electricity demand for Iran. In addition, shares of various RE resources and storage technologies have been estimated for the applied years, and all periods before in 5-year time steps. The model takes the 2015 installed power plant capacities, corresponding lifetimes and total electrical energy demand to compute and optimize the mix of RE plants needed to be installed to achieve a 100\% RE power system by 2050. The optimization is carried out on the basis of assumed costs and technological status of all energy technologies involved. Moreover, the role of storage technologies in the energy system, and integration of the power sector with desalination and non-energetic industrial gas sectors are examined. Our results reveal that RE technologies can fulfil all electricity demand by the year 2050 at a price level of about 41 - 47 {\texteuro}/MWhel depending on the sectorial integration. Moreover, the combination of solar PV and battery storage is found as a least cost solution after 2030 for Iran. If the capacity in 2050 would have been invested for the cost assumptions of 2050 the cost would be 32 - 40 {\texteuro}/MWhel, depending on the sectorial integration, which can be expected for the time beyond 2050.}

To facilitate broader analysis, several datasets of the social costs of air quality have been produced by a set of reduced-complexity models (RCMs). It is much easier to use the tabulated marginal costs derived from RCMs than it is to run `state-of-the-science' chemical transport models (CTMs). However, the differences between these datasets have not been systematically examined, leaving analysts with no guidance on how and when these differences matter. Here, we compare per-tonne marginal costs from ground level and elevated emission sources for each county in the United States for sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH3) and inert primary PM2.5 from three RCMs: Air Pollution Emission Experiments and Policy (AP2), Estimating Air pollution Social Impacts Using Regression (EASIUR) and the Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP). National emission-weighted average damages vary among models by approximately 21\%, 31\%, 28\% and 12\% for inert primary PM2.5, SO2, NOx and NH3 emissions, respectively, for ground-level sources. For elevated sources, emission-weighted damages vary by approximately 42\%, 26\%, 42\% and 20\% for inert primary PM2.5, SO2, NOx and NH3 emissions, respectively. Despite fundamental structural differences, the three models predict marginal costs that are within the same order of magnitude. That different and independent methods have converged on similar results bolsters confidence in the RCMs. Policy analyzes of national-level air quality policies that sum over pollutants and geographical locations are often robust to these differences, although the differences may matter for more source- or location-specific analyzes. Overall, the loss of fidelity caused by using RCMs and their social cost datasets in place of CTMs is modest.},

  abstract = {With its abundance of renewable energy potentials, not only for hydropower and bioenergy, but also for wind and solar, Brazil provides good prospects for a carbon neutral energy system. The role of an enhanced coupling of the power, heat and transport sectors in such systems is not yet fully understood. This paper analyses the least-cost composition and operation of a fully renewable power supply system as part of a carbon neutral energy supply in Brazil. It relies on the application of the high-resolution energy system model REMix. Our analysis reveals that the expansion of wind and solar power is more cost-efficient than the construction of additional hydroelectric plants. This is favoured because the existing hydroelectric plants offer large capacity of dispatchable power to compensate for fluctuations, and thus no additional storage is necessary. Furthermore, the REMix analysis indicates that varying shares of solar and wind power technologies as well as the spatial distribution of power generation have only a small influence on supply costs. This implies that the transformation strategy in Brazil can be primarily based on other criteria such as regional development, public acceptance, environmental impact or industrial policy without major impacts on system costs.},

  abstract = {As many other small islands and archipelagos, the Canary Islands depend to a high degree on energy imports. Despite its small surface, the archipelago has a high potential for renewable energy (RE) technologies. In this paper, we present a scenario pathway to a 100\% RE supply in the Canary Islands by 2050. It relies on a back-casting approach linking the bottom-up accounting framework Mesap-PlaNet and the high resolution power system model REMix. Our analysis shows that locally available technology potentials are sufficient for a fully renewable supply of the islands' power, heat, and land transport energy demands. To follow the pathway for achieving a carbon neutral supply, expansion of RE technology deployment needs to be accelerated in the short-term and efforts towards greater energy efficiency must be increased. According to our results, an extended linkage between energy sectors through electric vehicles as well as electric heating, and the usage of synthetic hydrogen can contribute notably to the integration of intermittent RE power generation. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of power transmission in RE supply systems. Supply costs are found 15\% lower in a scenario considering sea cable connections between all islands.}

The required types and capacities of balancing measures, amounts of curtailment, and costs associated with system integration need to be assessed for advising policy makers and economic actors. Previous studies mostly exclude storage from model-endogenous capacity expansion and omit concentrated solar power (CSP) completely. In this study, we stress the need for grid and backup capacity by investigating an integrated market in Europe, allowing for additional short-term as well as long-term storage and considering CSP as a dispatchable backup option. The Renewable Energy Mix (REMix) energy system model is introduced and applied to assess the capacity expansion and hourly dispatch at various levels of photovoltaic and wind power penetration. The model results demonstrate combinations of spatial and temporal balancing measures that enable net photovoltaic and wind supply shares of 60\% and 70\% of the annual demand, respectively. The usage of storage and grid can keep curtailments below 20\% of the demand for theoretical VRE shares of up to 100\%. Furthermore, we determine that the VRE supply structure has a strong impact on the least-cost allocation of power plants across Europe but only a limited effect on supply costs.}

This focus has led to an emphasis on the so-called ``social gap'' between positive general attitudes toward renewable energy development and local resistance to actual proposals. Instead, we conduct a fuzzy set/Qualitative Comparative Analysis of 53 proposals for wind energy development in the Western United States to better understand both the amount of local opposition and the factors and processes that shape it. We find that while some level of local opposition to wind proposals is not rare, it is typically restricted to more benign activities that require few resources and take place in standard institutional settings. Drawing on insights from the literatures on social acceptance of wind and social movement studies, we show that proximity to protected areas, political opportunity, and opponents' framing of the risks posed by wind development are important factors in driving community resistance. These findings suggest that resistance to wind energy proposals is more likely to be shaped by existing processes for public participation than to shape them, and that calls to streamline regulatory processes to expedite development due to local resistance may be premature.},

Assessments of visual impacts are frequently performed at a local scale for individual projects, but a comprehensive understanding of broader geographic patterns in visual impacts across the US is lacking. This paper presents a visual impact assessment of the existing land-based wind turbine fleet of the contiguous United States (CONUS). The assessment combines geographic information systems and 3D simulation methods to account for key factors driving the visual magnitude of impacts from the installed turbines. The results indicate that, despite the deployment of approximately 70,000 turbines and over 144 gigawatts of land-based wind in the CONUS, the visual impacts are very small when measured as a proportion of land area, population, and sensitive visual resources. Nonetheless, visual impacts are not evenly distributed: people experience a concentrated share in a small number of natural settings, primarily including plains, prairies, and deserts. Finally, we find that although increased density of wind development consistently leads to visual impacts across a greater proportion of land, it does not always lead to impacts to a greater share of the population. These findings suggest that visual impacts from wind energy are generally well-mitigated across the CONUS to date but also highlight the need for a deeper understanding of landscape sensitivity and individual perceptions of wind turbines in the most heavily impacted natural settings.}

The available capacity can be optimized in real time to take advantage of fluctuations in electricity prices and intermittent renewable power generation. We apply our model to the current environment in both Germany and Texas and find that renewable hydrogen is already cost competitive in niche applications ({\texteuro}3.23\,kg-1), although not yet for industrial-scale supply.

Less debate, however, has occurred regarding the impact such policies will have on significant fossil fuel producing regions in the country. Such impacts are important to consider, both from an equity and political perspective. If some regions are impacted more than others across a national society, this could create political opposition that could undermine the implementation of such policies. The purpose of this paper is to present one such impact analysis, estimating the potential economic effects the CPP could have on Wyoming, the nation's largest coal producing state. The paper also highlights how such estimates are heavily dependent on the initial simulation assumptions used to generate them. Using two sources of simulations, from Godby et al. (2015a), and a later set from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), estimates of the potential impact of the originally proposed CPP rules on Wyoming economy are described. Simulation results are shown to be highly sensitive to how policy is implemented, and modeling assumptions. Regardless of the simulation, however, economic impacts of the CPP are shown to be severe to a producing state like Wyoming, potentially reducing that state's employment by over 3\%, and reducing state revenues by 14\% or more.}

The role of energy storage and transmission under various assumptions about a) development of electric battery costs, b) transmission grid expansion restrictions, and c) the variability of future electricity demand is demonstrated. Two models are soft-linked -- LIBEMOD, a multimarket energy equilibrium model of Europe, and TIMES-Europe, a bottom-up stochastic model of the European electricity and district heat sectors -- to provide an analysis of the decarbonization of the electricity sector that has consistent assumptions about electricity use and fuel prices. To explicitly value flexibility, a stochastic methodology is used to ensure that investment decisions take into account different operational situations that can occur due to weather-dependent renewable generation and the uncertainty of the electricity demand. It is demonstrated that the European power sector can be decarbonised with a 65\%--70\% share of the electricity supply from wind power and PV in 2050. The cost-efficient investment in stationary batteries is highly dependent on technology development in PV and expansion of the international transmission grid.},

We compare time series aggregation methods and generation expansion planning models which aim to capture the value of long-term storage for the first time in the literature. Time Series Aggregations methods were compared by varying the number of representative periods and then running a full year generation expansion planning model on novel synthetic time series. Generation Expansion Planning Models were run on selections and ordering of representative periods in order to compare them. Our results suggest that approximating the full-year time series does not necessarily translate to approximating the fullyear generation expansion planning solution and that selecting hours or days is a greater determinant of performance than the time series aggregation method itself. Two of the generation expansion planning models considered, Enhanced Representative Days and Chronological Time Period Clustering, could capture the value of long-term storage, though over or underinvestment in long-term storage by more than a factor of 2 was also possible and the latter formulation exhibited a clear bias towards long-term storage. Based on these results we formulate recommendations for modelers seeking to include long-term storage in generation expansion planning models.},

Active grid connection requests are more than double the total installed capacity of the US power plant fleet (2,600 vs. 1,280 GW). The time required to secure a connection has increased by 70\% over the last decade, and withdrawal rates remain high at 80\%, suggesting a constrained transmission system that jeopardizes energy transition targets. Wide distributions of interconnection costs indicate the inherent uncertainty of the interconnection process. Interconnection requests that identify large transmission upgrades tend to withdraw from the process.

An improved understanding of these transmission costs would support electricity system planning as VRE penetrations increase. This paper brackets VRE transmission capital costs using multiple approaches based on interconnection studies, actual transmission projects, capacity-expansion simulation models, and aggregated U.S. VRE-related transmission expenditures. Each approach possesses advantages and drawbacks, and combining the approaches lends confidence to the results. The resulting range of average levelized VRE transmission costs is 1--10/MWh, which is generally lower than earlier estimates in the literature. These transmission capital costs can increase the direct plant-level levelized cost of VRE by 3\%--33\%, based on levelized costs of energy of 29--56/MWh for utility-scale wind and 36--46/MWh for utility-scale solar. As VRE deployment continues to expand, policy makers can use this information to (1) assess the benefits of transmission avoidance and deferral when comparing distributed energy resources versus utility-scale projects, (2) evaluate the potential costs of large-scale public transmission investments, and (3) better analyze system-level costs of utility-scale VRE technologies. Future research can expand on the framework presented here by providing a review of operation and maintenance costs for transmission systems.}

Revealed preference approaches to VoLL estimation are introduced that offer attractive theo\- retical advantages over traditional estimation methods.

  abstract = {Under its recently proposed Clean Power Plan, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gives states several ``building blocks'' to choose from to reduce their power plants' CO2 emissions, including improving plants' heat rate efficiency. However, skeptics suggest that precisely because efficiency enhances electrical output, it may reduce power plants' emission rates but increase their emission levels. Using the EPA's new Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) data, this paper conducts the first analysis of the effect of thermal efficiency on the rate and level at which individual power plants emit carbon dioxide. Consistent with the arguments of skeptics, we find that while efficiency lowers CO2 emission rates, it actually increases CO2 emission levels. In suggesting to states that improving efficiency is one of the best systems of emission reductions, therefore, the EPA needs to consider whether more efficient plants are subject to such ``rebound effects.''}

  abstract = {Nuclear power had its heyday in the 1970s in the United States, and many of the nuclear power plants constructed during that period are now facing the end of their design life. Consequently, nuclear power plant closures and unsitings are emerging as highly contentious public issues. In an effort to provide a more nuanced account of nuclear power plant closures, we adopt theoretical vantage points from the geographical political economy literature. Our analysis focuses on the articulation and characterization of socio-spatial ``moments'' of closure processes rather than enumerating underlying ``factors'' in order to better explain variegated plant closure outcomes. For empirical analysis, we examine two contrasting cases of recent conflict over nuclear power plant closure in the northeastern United States, involving the Vermont Yankee and FitzPatrick plants. These closure episodes show marked differences in region-level activism. Yet the presence of these movements alone is insufficient in accounting for particular outcomes (the when and how) of the plant closure controversies. Our analysis highlights the agency of key state actors and their selective deployment of various global and local themes, such as nuclear disaster in Fukushima, global climate change, corporate accountability, and regional economic conditions, to define and promote their goals. Our study also demonstrates how the moments of closure decisions can be opened up by viewing the closure controversies from the owner company side, pointing to the usefulness of not only comparative, but also of connective accounts that highlight spatio-temporal links between closure processes.},

  abstract = {Due to the rapid decrease of the costs of photovoltaics, large schemes for solar electricity generation have recently been suggested. The new method of isolines or contour lines between generation capacity and storage for a specific load allows a thorough review of these schemes. Such a review is necessary given that the costs of photovoltaics have been and are decreasing much more rapidly than the costs of storage. We apply this method to the ``Solar Grand Plan'' proposed by Zweibel, Fthenakis and Mason. The Grand Plan connects only a small number of time zones and is restricted to the northern hemisphere. Schemes recently suggested, e.g., for the Asian--Australian region would connect both hemispheres. In such spatially extended schemes the substitutability between generation capacity and storage can be extended to also include transmission lines. We review the Grand Plan against the background of several spatially extended Pan-American schemes and show how major drawbacks of the Grand Plan with respect to overcapacity can be overcome based on hourly scaling of NASA Solar Sizer insolation data and optimization of the required generation capacity and storage. We then outline transmission lines for Pan-American networks, transmission costs, projected solar electricity costs, and line utilization rates. In addition to enabling significant cost savings through reduced overcapacity, Pan-American schemes enable revenue flows and improved availability of electricity that are favorable for economic development.}

  abstract = {The increasing share of decentralized intermittent renewable energy reinforces the necessity of balancing local production and consumption. Decentralized energy systems, powered by renewable energy technologies and incorporating storage and conversion technologies, are promising options to cope with this challenge. Many studies have evaluated their potential contributions, but an overview of the status-quo in both academia and practice is missing. The extant literature lacks a comprehensive review of the scientific knowledge on decentralized energy systems, partially attributed to the lack of common terminology. Additionally, it remains unclear what kind of systems are already implemented today worldwide as they have not yet been thoroughly analyzed and described. However, pilot projects provide valuable insights into future applications and operational aspects. To fill these gaps, an extensive review of the current state of literature and practice is conducted. To do so, 64 publications and 56 projects were analyzed and an overview is provided using four criteria: terminology, scope/motivation, application, and technical configuration. These criteria facilitate the understanding of decentralized energy systems needed to spur their development and diffusion. Further advancements of research and practice are discussed. For example, technological learning hinges on a common terminology and on an identification of optimal technical configurations per application. There are both avenues for future research.

  abstract = {Some chemical processes, like the chlor-alkali production, generate significant amount of hydrogen as byproduct whose recovery within the chemical plant is not always possible. An efficient and attractive use of hydrogen is obtained installing a PEM fuel cell-based cogeneration unit, whose electricity and heat production covers part of plant consumptions. Practical application of this concept requires scaling up the fuel cell plant up to the multi-MW scale, an ongoing process with many open challenges where the development of dedicated modeling tools allows evaluating the plant expected performances and optimizing its operational strategies. This work presents the results of a the simulation activity modeling of an innovative 2 MW PEM fuel cell power plant, developed within the European project DEMCOPEM-2MW. Simulations are performed with ASPEN Plus{\textregistered}, including a specifically developed lumped model for the stacks in order to investigate their behavior as function of inlet streams conditions and of power set point. The BOP is modeled with particular attention to component expected operating conditions, efficiency, auxiliary consumption, pressure drops. The model is calibrated and validated on data from PEM stacks operated by Nedstack and MTSA in previous installations. Stacks model performs lumped energy and mass balances according to regressed polarization curves; cells decay is modeled through simplified assumptions aiming at evidencing the impact on auxiliaries operation and on global efficiency. Comparison with a different arrangement where excess hydrogen exiting the fuel cell anode is oxidized in a combustor, instead of being recirculated to the fuel cell, is also set up evidencing the possibility to increase the heat to electricity ratio and allow high temperature heat production. The model also allows assessing and optimizing the plant operational strategies (e.g. minimizing the power production and efficiency losses vs. lifetime), evaluating the deviations of real plant behavior from theoretical conditions.}

  abstract = {Currently, many countries try to satisfy their energy needs with an increasing usage of renewable resources. The general motivations, with varying weighting in the different countries, are ecological reasons, concerns about energy security, and economical considerations. A for now rather theoretical question, although interesting for opening a long-term perspective, is how an energy supply from exclusively renewable energy resources could look like. This question has to be answered individually for any specific energy supply system. The present paper has the objective to present and evaluate a scenario for an electricity supply only from renewable energy resources for the Java-Bali grid. After designing a load time series for the year 2050 for the Java-Bali grid, a scenario is developed how to cover the load with electricity from renewable energy resources alone. Assumptions about the usable energy sources are made as well as assumptions about the available power plant capacity or energy potential. A specific challenge is the fact that solar energy must be the main source in such a renewable-energy based system, which comes with the need for a large storage capacity to match the power supply at any time with the load. Several possibilities are presented how to bring down the storage capacity: the increment of the installed PV capacity, the usage of bioenergy for seasonal balancing, and the complementation of the proposed short-term storage with an additional long-term storage. The study shows some of the specific challenges that a gradual transformation of the current electricity supply system on Java and Bali into a renewable-energy-based one would face and gives some hints about how to cope with these challenges. Scenarios like the one designed in this study are an important tool for decision-makers who face the task to scrutinize the consequences of choosing between different development paths.~Article History: Received: August 15th 2017; Received: October 18th 2017; Accepted: January 14th 2018; Available onlineHow to Cite This Article: G{\"u}nther, M., Ganal, I. and Bofinger, S.

Its derivation uses the same two-band scheme as in the previous CPCR2 model, but with numerous improvements. Great attention is devoted to precisely account for the effect of aerosols, in particular. Detailed research-class measurements from Billings, OK are used to assess the performance of the model for the prediction of direct, diffuse and global broadband irradiance. These measurements were made in May 2003 during a sophisticated radiative closure experiment, which involved the best radiometric instrumentation currently available and many ancillary instruments. As a whole, these exceptional measurements constitute the only known modern benchmark dataset made specifically to test the intrinsic performance of radiation models. Using this dataset as reference, it is shown that REST2 performs better than CPCR2 for irradiance, illuminance or PAR predictions. The availability of the turbidity data required by REST2 or other similar models is also discussed, as well as the effect that turbidity has on each component of broadband irradiance, PAR irradiance and illuminance, and on the diffuse/global PAR ratio.}

A cost-optimal 100\% renewable energy based system is simulated for East Asia for the year 2030, covering demand by power, desalination, and industrial gas sectors on an hourly basis for an entire year. East Asia was divided into 20 sub-regions and four different scenarios were set up based on the level of high voltage grid connection, and additional demand sectors: power, desalination, industrial gas, and a renewable-energy-based synthetic natural gas (RE-SNG) trading between regions. The integrated RE-SNG scenario gives the lowest cost of electricity ({\texteuro}52/MWh) and the lowest total annual cost of the system. Results contradict the notion that long-distance power lines could be beneficial to utilize the abundant solar and wind resources in Australia for East Asia. However, Australia could become a liquefaction hub for exporting RE-SNG to Asia and a 100\% renewable energy system could be a reality in East Asia with the cost assumptions used.

This was reflected in the decrease of system cost by 9.5\% and the total electricity generation by 5.1\%. According to the results, grid integration on a larger scale decreases the total system cost and levelized cost of electricity by reducing the need for storage technologies due to seasonal variations in weather and demand profiles. The intermittency of renewable technologies can be effectively stabilized to satisfy hourly demand at a low cost level. A 100\% renewable energy based system could be a reality economically and technically in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Rim with the cost assumptions used in this research and it may be more cost competitive than the nuclear and fossil carbon capture and storage (CCS) alternatives.},

  abstract = {The initiatives taken by India to tap its renewable energy (RE) potential have been extraordinary in recent years. However, large scale deployment of renewables requires various storage solutions to balance intermittency. In this work, a 100\% RE transition pathway based on an hourly resolved model till 2050 is simulated for India, covering demand by the power, desalination and non-energetic industrial gas sectors. Energy storage technologies used in the model that provide flexibility to the system and balance the demand are batteries, pumped hydro storage (PHS), adiabatic compressed air energy storage (A-CAES), thermal energy storage (TES) and power-to-gas technology. The optimization for each time period (transition is modeled in 5-year steps) is carried out on assumed costs and technological status of all energy technologies involved. The model optimizes the least cost mix of RE power plants and storage technologies installed to achieve a fully RE based power system by 2050 considering the base year's (2015) installed power plant capacities, their lifetimes and total electricity demand. Results indicate that a 100\% renewable energy based energy system is achievable in 2050 with the levelised cost of electricity falling from a current level of 58 {\texteuro}/MWhe to 52 {\texteuro}/MWhe in 2050 in a country-wide scenario. If the capacity in 2050 would have been invested for the cost assumptions of 2050 the cost would be 42 {\texteuro}/MWhe, which can be expected for the time beyond 2050. With large scale intermittent renewable energy sources in the system, the demand for storage technologies increases from the current level to 2050. Batteries provide 2596 TWh, PHS provides 12 TWh and gas storage provides 197 TWh of electricity to the total electricity demand. Most of the storage demand will be based on batteries, which provide as much as 42\% of the total electricity demand. The combination of solar PV and battery storage evolves as the low-cost backbone of Indian energy supply, resulting in 3.2 -- 4.3 TWp of installed PV capacities, depending on the applied scenario in 2050. The above results clearly prove that renewable energy options are the most competitive and least-cost solution for achieving a net zero emission energy system. This is the first study of its kind in full hourly resolution for India}

In future, providing affordable, universally accessible, reliable, low to zero carbon electricity in this region will be the main aim. A cost optimal 100\% renewable energy system is simulated for SAARC for the year 2030 on an hourly resolved basis. The region was divided into 16 sub-regions and three different scenarios were set up based on the level of high voltage direct current (HVDC) grid connections. The results obtained for a total system levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) showed a decrease from 71.6 {\texteuro}/MWh in a decentralized to 67.2 {\texteuro}/MWh for a centralized grid connected scenario. An additional scenario was simulated to show the benefits of integrating industrial gas production and seawater reverse osmosis desalination demand, and showed the system cost decreased by 5\% and total electricity generation decreased by 1\%. The results show that a 100\% renewable energy system could be a reality in the SAARC region with the cost assumptions used in this research and it may be more cost competitive than nuclear and fossil carbon capture and storage (CCS) alternatives. One of the limitations of this study is the cost of land for installation of renewables which is not included in the LCOE calculations, but regarded as a minor contribution.},

  abstract = {Energy storage systems (ESS) are a structural solution for the integration of renewable energy systems. To plan the optimal combination of ESS, storage expansion planning approaches are commonly used. They tend to focus on balancing the energy fluctuations from renewable technologies but are usually blind to the need for specific additional services required for dealing with forecast errors. Hence, they underestimate the real operating costs of the future power system and lead to suboptimal investment recommendations. In response, we propose a multi-service storage expansion approach. A linear programming optimization is developed, LEELO, to find the optimal investments in a 100\% renewable system (based on solar photovoltaic and wind power) deciding on renewable generators and storage systems. In our formulation, we explicitly model the provisioning of power reserves and energy autonomy as additional services. A case study applies our model to Chile considering four regions and the (existing) hydropower park, for a complete year with an hourly resolution. We systematically assess how our novel multi-service planning differs from conventional energy-based planning in terms of total costs, operation, and investment decisions (with a focus on ESS). Considering power reserves and energy autonomy reveals on average 20\% higher costs that otherwise would not be captured in the expansion planning process. Regarding operation, ESS show only slight differences in the two planning models. All ESS participate in the provision of energy. As might be expected, batteries are the main provider of (short-term) power reserves, assisted by pumped-hydro, whereas hydrogen storage is responsible for providing (long-term) energy autonomy. However, the storage investment decisions differ significantly between both models. In our multi-service model, the attained power capacities and energy capacities are up to 1.6 and 3.2 times larger, respectively than in conventional planning. The resulting storage mix changes even more strongly: a general shift towards hydrogen systems is observed. Mainly batteries are substituted, while pumped-hydro capacities stay relatively constant. The trend of the above results is consistent for various scenarios of wind and photovoltaic generation and for sensitivities of service parameters. Our findings underline the importance of modeling multi-services in the planning of renewable-based power systems.}

Building from existing probabilistic methods for assessing the volumes of energy and mineral resources, we provide an algorithm for consistent, reproducible, quantitative assessment of resource development impacts. The approach combines probabilistic input data with Monte Carlo statistical methods to determine probabilistic outputs that convey the uncertainties inherent in the data. For example, one can utilize our algorithm to combine data from a natural gas resource assessment with maps of sage grouse leks and pi{\~n}on-juniper woodlands in the same area to estimate possible future habitat impacts due to possible future gas development. As another example: one could combine geochemical data and maps of lynx habitat with data from a mineral deposit assessment in the same area to determine possible future mining impacts on water resources and lynx habitat. The approach can be applied to a broad range of positive and negative resource development impacts, such as water quantity or quality, economic benefits, or air quality, limited only by the availability of necessary input data and quantified relationships among geologic resources, development alternatives, and impacts. The framework enables quantitative evaluation of the trade-offs inherent in resource management decision-making, including cumulative impacts, to address societal concerns and policy aspects of resource development.},

We show that ambitious emission reduction targets can be achieved at moderate costs by a nearly complete switch to RE sources until 2050, if transmission and storage capacities are expanded adequately. Limiting transmission capacities to current levels leads to higher storage requirements, higher curtailments, and to an increase in temporal and spatial electricity price variations. Results show an escalation of electricity prices if emission reductions exceed a critical value. Adequate expansion of transmission and storage capacities shift this threshold from 70\% to 90\% emission reductions in 2050 relative to 2010.}

The Mid-Columbia system consists of seven hydropower plants on the Columbia River in the United States. The state-space model used in the control scheme accounts for system hydraulics, modeling time-delayed hydraulic coupling and dynamic tailrace elevations. We approximate the power generation from a hydropower plant using a piecewise planar function of turbine discharge and hydraulic head, and we demonstrate how this approximation can be written as a set of linear constraints and integrated into a quadratic program. We introduce a flow minimizing objective function that maximizes system hydraulic potential by efficiently allocating water. Compared to historical operations, the proposed control scheme reduces ramping, increases total system hydraulic head, increases system energy content, and operates the system within all elevation and flow constraints.}

This approach addresses the dynamic nature of the transition, where the degree of transition has an ongoing, beneficial and compounding effect on future technological deployments. In other words, as the energy system evolves, renewable energy technologies are made increasingly with renewable energy, thus becoming renewable energy `breeders'. We apply this routine to four previously published scenarios for the transition of the Australian electricity sector, which at present accounts for about one-third of the country's annual CO2eq emissions. We find that three of the four scenarios fail to satisfy the electricity sector's proportion of Australia's share of the 2.0~{$^\circ$}C/66\% IPCC carbon budget, and none of them achieves the 1.5~{$^\circ$}C budget. Only the High Carbon Price scenario could be deemed to have made any meaningful impact. An urgent, rapid transition to 100\% renewable energy must be made in the whole energy sector, not just electricity, if the 1.5~{$^\circ$}C budget is to be satisfied.}

We find the rate of performance decline to be 0.53\%/year for older vintages of plants and 0.17\%/year for newer vintages of plants on an energy basis for the first 10 years of operation, which is on the lower end of prior estimates in Europe. Unique to the United States, we find a significant drop in performance by 3.6\% after 10 years, as plants lose eligibility for the production tax credit. Certain plant characteristics, such as the ratio of blade length to nameplate capacity, influence the rate of performance decline. These results indicate that the performance decline rate can be partially managed and influenced by policy.},

The purpose of this study is to advance the knowledge of transitioning the German energy system to 100\% renewable energy towards 2050. Taking into consideration renewable resource potentials, energy system costs and primary energy supply this study develops a path for transitioning the German energy system within the heating, industrial, transport and electricity sectors. The analysis demonstrates that it is possible to carry out this transition from a technical and economic perspective with some measures being vital for achieving this ambition in a cost-effective manner. The most significant challenge in this transition is regarding resource potentials where especially biomass resources are constrained and under pressure. Finally, the most influential measures for achieving the renewable transition are discussed.}

However, an increasing number of studies apply a cross-sectoral holistic approach on the entire energy system. Most studies analyse energy systems for the final 100\% renewable state, while a small, though increasing, number also investigate energy transition pathways; how to reach the target. Europe, and thereafter the US and Australia, are well researched, while other parts of the world lack behind, and there is a focus on individual country studies.

  abstract = {Power prices have fallen significantly since 2008, putting commercial nuclear reactors in the United States under substantial financial pressure. In this market environment characterized by persistently low natural gas prices and stagnant electricity demand, the analysis shows that about two thirds of the 100 GW nuclear capacity are uncompetitive over the next few years under the current trajectory. Among those in merchant deregulated markets, 21 GW are retiring, or are at high risk of retiring prematurely. The potential consequences of the hypothetical withdrawal of 30 GW of nuclear capacity include: 1) a {\textasciitilde}5\% increase in carbon emissions if replaced by gas-fired units or 2) a cost of subsidies greater than \$8 billion per year if replaced by renewables. Without a carbon price, out-of-the-market payments would be needed to effectively maintain nuclear capacity in deregulated markets. Filling the revenue gap would come at a cost of \$4-7/ MWh on average in these markets, which is much lower than the cost of subsidizing wind power. The policy support could take the form of direct zero-emission credits, renewable portfolio standard expansion, or clean capacity market mechanisms. As a last resort, the exercise of a new mothballing status could prevent the retirement of nuclear plants.},

  abstract = {Increasing penetrations of intermittent renewable energy generation introduce novel balancing and reliability challenges for electricity systems. Mismatches between renewable energy production and electricity demand cause periods of overgeneration and periods of undergeneration. These latter energy deficit periods will result in reliability challenges unless additional balancing solutions are employed. Energy deficits can range from a few hours to days to seasons to years. A least cost energy system will best meet these balancing challenges with diverse investments in energy infrastructure, depending on technology costs, natural resource availability, interconnectedness, and evolving load patterns, including flexible loads. Short-term and long-term storage applications may both be part of this portfolio. This study looks at storage in isolation to show the types of tradeoffs present between one storage resource and another in providing balancing services. The best storage technologies to balance the system depend on the duration of deficit events it is designed to mitigate. This paper compares the economics of different storage technology types in providing the range of short-term to long-term storage applications. The results compare quantities of conceptual storage technologies at different price points and quantities of clean gas generation to serve balancing needs as part of a least cost portfolio. We examine the tradeoffs between gas generation with low capital costs but high variable costs when burning clean fuels, and the alternative conceptual storage technologies, showing why clean gas capacity may play a role in least cost resource portfolios in decarbonized electricity systems.},

  abstract = {The expansion of wind power poses distinct and varied geographic challenges to a sustainable energy transition. However, current knowledge of its land use impacts and synergies is limited by reliance on static characterizations that overlook the role of turbine technology and plant design in mediating interactions with the environment. Here, we investigate how wind technology development and innovation have shaped landscape interactions with social and ecological systems within the United States and contribute to evolving land area requirements. This work assesses trends in key land use facets of wind power using a holistic set of metrics to establish an evidence base that researchers, technology designers, land use managers, and policymakers can use in envisioning how future wind-intensive energy systems may be jointly optimized for clean energy, social, and environmental objectives. Since 2000, we find dynamic land occupancy patterns and regional trends that are driven by advancing technology and geographic factors. Though most historical U.S. wind deployment has been confined to the temperate grassland biome in the nation's interior, regional expansion has implicated diverse land use and cover types. A large percentage of the typical wind plant footprint ({$\sim$}96\% to 99\%) is not directly impacted by permanent physical infrastructure, allowing for multiple uses in the spaces between turbines. Surprisingly, turbines are commonly close to built structures. Moreover, rangeland and cropland have supported 93.4\% of deployment, highlighting potential synergies with agricultural lands. Despite broadly decreasing capacity densities, offsetting technology improvements have stabilized power densities. Land use intensity, defined as the ratio of direct land usage to lifetime power generation of wind facilities, has also trended downwards. Although continued deployment on disturbed lands, and in close proximity to existing wind facilities and other infrastructure, could minimize the extent of impacts, ambitious decarbonization trajectories may predispose particular biomes to cumulative effects and risks from regional wind power saturation. Increased land-use and sustainability feedback in technology and plant design will be critical to sustainable management of wind power.},

Hybrid VRE systems offer potential reliability benefits with stochastic wind and solar. Here, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of temporal complementarity for co-located wind-PV hybrid systems at greater than 1.7 million locations across the contiguous United States. We model hourly variation in potential wind and solar generation for a period spanning 2007--2013 and evaluate robust evidence for complementarity using multiple metrics to assess correlations and stabilization benefits achieved via hybridization. We further explore regional case studies to investigate whether complementarity is an indicator of value, using price taker analysis to quantify the current and expected future value factor for hybrid systems. We find most locations in the U.S. (except for mountainous regions) offer complementarity of hourly wind and PV generation annually with modest seasonal variation. The stability coefficient is a better indicator of value in regions with large variation in wind potential and significant PV penetrations whereas the correlation metrics more clearly indicate value in regions where wind and PV both provide significant shares of generation. Overall, we find broad support for wind-PV hybrid systems to exploit resource synergies with economic benefits.}

The model combines a deterministic renewable portfolio planning module with a Monte Carlo simulation of system operation that determines the expected least-cost dispatch from each technology, the necessary reserve capacity, and the expected carbon emissions at each hour. Each system is designed to meet a maximum loss of load expectation requirement of 1 day in 10 years. The present study includes wind, centralized solar thermal, and rooftop photovoltaics, as well as hydroelectric, geothermal, and natural gas plants. The portfolios produced by the model take advantage of the aggregation of variable generators at multiple geographically disperse sites and the incorporation of meteorological and load forecasts. Results are presented from a model run of the continuous two-year period, 2005--2006 in the California ISO operating area. A low-carbon portfolio is produced for this system that is capable of achieving an 80\% reduction in electric power sector carbon emissions from 2005 levels and supplying over 99\% of the annual delivered load with non-carbon sources. A portfolio is also built for a projected 2050 system, which is capable of providing 96\% of the delivered electricity from non-carbon sources, despite a projected doubling of the 2005 system peak load. The results suggest that further reductions in carbon emissions may be achieved with emerging technologies that can reliably provide large capacities without necessarily providing positive net annual energy generation. These technologies may include demand response, vehicle-to-grid systems, and large-scale energy storage.}

Dispatch models are applied to derive hourly prices for the market region of Austria and Germany for increasing installed capacities of photovoltaic. These prices are used to calculate potential revenues for storage systems. Results show that the effect of increased feed in from photovoltaic depends on the penetration level. For low shares of photovoltaic in total electricity generation decreasing revenues and price variances are observed because of high correlations between demand peaks and solar radiation. The minimum of revenues for storage plants is reached at around 5\% PV penetration level. For higher shares revenues start to increase significantly and are expected to be higher than initial revenues for penetration levels {$>$}10\%. Considering current shares of photovoltaic in Germany and Austria (year 2016) it is estimated that the effect of photovoltaic on price variance is around the observed minimum and price spreads can be expected to rise again with higher PV penetration. With respect to investment incentives results show that although storage options can support the integration of high shares of intermittent renewables, short term needs and consequently electricity price signals might be low.}

The considered scenarios for a future hydrogen transition show that a green hydrogen economy is beneficial in terms of mitigated carbon dioxide emissions for all policy-relevant time-horizons and leakage rates. In contrast, the carbon dioxide and methane emissions associated with blue hydrogen reduce the benefit of a hydrogen economy and lead to a climate penalty at high leakage rate or blue hydrogen share. The leakage rate and the hydrogen production pathways are key leverages to reach a clear climate benefit from a large-scale transition to a hydrogen economy.},

The team leveraged a reanalysis-derived database to estimate the wind and solar power resources and their interannual variability under current climate conditions (1985-2005). Then a projected future climate database for the time range of 2040-2069 was derived based on the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) regional climate model (RCM) simulations driven by free-running atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCMs). In order to compare current and future climate variability, the team developed a baseline by decomposing the current climate reanalysis database into Self Organizing Maps (SOMs) to determine the predominant modes of variability. The current climate patterns found were compared with those of a NARCCAP-based future climate scenario and the CRCM/CCSM combination was chosen to describe the future climate scenario. The future climate scenarios' data were projected onto the Climate Four Dimensional Data Assimilation (CFDDA) reanalysis SOMs. The projected future climate database was then created by resampling the reanalysis based on the frequency of occurrence of the future SOM patterns, adjusting for the differences in magnitude of the wind speed or solar irradiance between the current and future climate conditions.Comparison of the changes in the frequency of occurrence of the SOM modes between current and future climate conditions indicate that the annual mean wind speed and solar irradiance could be expected to change by up to 10\% (increasing or decreasing regionally).}

  abstract = {Natural gas has significant potential carbon benefits over coal when used for electricity generation, but these benefits can be offset by emissions of fugitive methane or delays in the adoption of near-zero carbon technologies. We analyze the time-evolution of radiative forcing from both natural gas and coal-based electricity generation by calculating average radiative forcing over an interval of time from greenhouse gas emissions under a range of assumptions for fugitive methane leakage, electricity generation efficiency, and delays in the adoption of near-zero carbon technologies. We find that leakage rates of between 5.2\% and 9.9\% are required for natural gas to result in greater mean forcing than coal over the next 100 years. We show that natural gas infrastructure with modest leakage could remain in place for 1.5--2.4 times the time interval that coal generation would have persisted prior to replacement with near-zero carbon technologies before the climate benefits of replacing coal with natural gas are negated. Natural gas can serve a viable bridge away from coal-based generation if avoiding longer-term climate impacts is prioritized, fugitive methane emissions are minimized, and the large-scale transition to near-zero carbon alternatives is unlikely to happen in the near-term.}

I suggest that this goal can be reached at a cost in the range of \$37 to \$135 bn/year. I assume that the goal is to be reached by extensive use of solar PV and wind energy (66\% of generating capacity), in which case the cost of energy storage plays a key role in the overall cost. I conclude tentatively that more limited use of renewables (less than 50\%) together with increased use of nuclear power might be less costly.},

  abstract = {An effective response to climate change demands rapid replacement of fossil carbon energy sources. This must occur concurrently with an ongoing rise in total global energy consumption. While many modelled scenarios have been published claiming to show that a 100\% renewable electricity system is achievable, there is no empirical or historical evidence that demonstrates that such systems are in fact feasible. Of the studies published to date, 24 have forecast regional, national or global energy requirements at sufficient detail to be considered potentially credible. We critically review these studies using four novel feasibility criteria for reliable electricity systems needed to meet electricity demand this century. These criteria are: (1) consistency with mainstream energy-demand forecasts; (2) simulating supply to meet demand reliably at hourly, half-hourly, and five-minute timescales, with resilience to extreme climate events; (3) identifying necessary transmission and distribution requirements; and (4) maintaining the provision of essential ancillary services. Evaluated against these objective criteria, none of the 24 studies provides convincing evidence that these basic feasibility criteria can be met. Of a maximum possible unweighted feasibility score of seven, the highest score for any one study was four. Eight of 24 scenarios (33\%) provided no form of system simulation. Twelve (50\%) relied on unrealistic forecasts of energy demand. While four studies (17\%; all regional) articulated transmission requirements, only two scenarios---drawn from the same study---addressed ancillary-service requirements. In addition to feasibility issues, the heavy reliance on exploitation of hydroelectricity and biomass raises concerns regarding environmental sustainability and social justice. Strong empirical evidence of feasibility must be demonstrated for any study that attempts to construct or model a low-carbon energy future based on any combination of low-carbon technology. On the basis of this review, efforts to date seem to have substantially underestimated the challenge and delayed the identification and implementation of effective and comprehensive decarbonization pathways.}

  abstract = {Recent technological advances in the recovery of unconventional natural gas, particularly shale gas, have served to dramatically increase domestic production and reserve estimates for the United States and internationally. This trend has led to lowered prices and increased scrutiny on production practices. Questions have been raised as to how greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the life cycle of shale gas production and use compares with that of conventionally produced natural gas or other fuel sources such as coal. Recent literature has come to different conclusions on this point, largely due to differing assumptions, comparison baselines, and system boundaries. Through a meta-analytical procedure we call harmonization, we develop robust, analytically consistent, and updated comparisons of estimates of life cycle GHG emissions for electricity produced from shale gas, conventionally produced natural gas, and coal. On a per-unit electrical output basis, harmonization reveals that median estimates of GHG emissions from shale gas-generated electricity are similar to those for conventional natural gas, with both approximately half that of the central tendency of coal. Sensitivity analysis on the harmonized estimates indicates that assumptions regarding liquids unloading and estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of wells have the greatest influence on life cycle GHG emissions, whereby shale gas life cycle GHG emissions could approach the range of best-performing coal-fired generation under certain scenarios. Despite clarification of published estimates through harmonization, these initial assessments should be confirmed through methane emissions measurements at components and in the atmosphere and through better characterization of EUR and practices.},

Most of these policies have five or more years of implementation experience, enabling an assessment of their costs and benefits. Understanding RPS benefits and costs is essential for policymakers evaluating existing RPS policies, assessing the need for modifications, and considering new policies. This report surveys and summarizes existing state-level RPS cost and benefit estimates and examines the various methods used to calculate such estimates. The report relies largely upon data or results reported directly by electric utilities and state regulators. As such, the estimated costs and benefits itemized in this document do not result from the application of a standardized approach or the use of a consistent set of underlying assumptions. Because the reported values may differ from those derived through a more consistent analytical treatment, we do not provide an aggregate national estimate of RPS costs and benefits, nor do we attempt to quantify net RPS benefits at national or state levels. The report summarizes state-level RPS costs to date and considers how those costs may evolve going forward given scheduled increases in RPS targets and cost containment mechanisms incorporated into existing policies. The report also summarizes RPS benefits estimates, based on published studies for individual states, and discusses key methodological considerations. These estimates, for example, of the social value of carbon emissions reduction and the human health impacts of reduced air emissions, are based on a variety of methodologies and assumptions. In comparison to the summary of estimated RPS costs, the summary of RPS benefits is more limited, as relatively few states have undertaken detailed benefits estimates. Further, for those states that have estimated RPS benefits, most assess only a limited number of impact types; as a consequence,}

The storage energy capacity, the annual balancing energy and the balancing power are found to depend significantly on the mixing ratio between wind and solar power generation. They decrease strongly with the overall excess generation. At 50\% excess generation the required long-term storage energy capacity and annual balancing energy amount to 1\% of the annual consumption. The required balancing power turns out to be 25\% of the average hourly load. These numbers are in agreement with current hydro storage lakes in Scandinavia and the Alps, as well as with potential hydrogen storage in mostly North-German salt caverns.}

The best point of counterbalancing represents the seasonal optimal mix between wind and solar power generation. It leads to a pronounced minimum in required stored energy. For a 100\% renewable Europe the seasonal optimal mix becomes 55\% wind and 45\% solar power generation. For less than 100\% renewable scenarios the fraction of wind power generation increases and that of solar power generation decreases.}

The correlation between the expansion of wind power generation and anticipated future demand has the potential to result in network congestion. Traditional Static Thermal Rating (STR) is a conservative parameter used to characterize the performance of electrical equipment. The energy output of wind generation integrated to the transmission system, which may exacerbate uncertainty due to the stochastic variability of wind speed, is subject to constraints imposed by static rating limitations. Dynamic thermal rating (DTR) is a cutting-edge approach for dynamically assess the thermal capacity of electrical equipment, offering a promising solution for optimizing power transmission. This study explores the DTR technology's application in the context of wind power integration. Other smart technologies, such as Energy Storage Systems (ESS) and topology reconfiguration, are integrated with DTR to assess their impact on the wind farm.

  abstract = {In the past, power system planning was based on meeting the load duration curve at minimum cost. The increasing share of variable generation (VG) makes operational constraints more important in the planning problem, and there is more and more interest in considering aspects such as sufficient ramping capability, sufficient reserve procurement, power system stability, storage behavior, and the integration of other energy sectors often through demand response assets. In VG integration studies, several methods have been applied to combine the planning and operational timescales. We present a four-level categorization for the modeling methods, in order of increasing complexity: (1a) investment model only, (1b) operational model only, (2) unidirectionally soft-linked investment and operational models, (3a) bidirectionally soft-linked investment and operational models, (3b) operational model with an investment update algorithm, and (4) co-optimization of investments and operation. The review shows that using a low temporal resolution or only few representative days will not suffice in order to determine the optimal generation portfolio. In addition, considering operational effects proves to be important in order to get a more optimal generation portfolio and more realistic estimations of system costs. However, operational details appear to be less significant than the temporal representation. Furthermore, the benefits and impacts of more advanced modeling techniques on the resulting generation capacity mix significantly depend on the system properties. Thus, the choice of the model should depend on the purpose of the study as well as on system characteristics.

The established method also allows the comparison of the influence on the extra-costs of the actual electricity mix, as well as the current electricity prices, corresponding to the above regional areas. In these calculations, we have taken into account several frequently ignored factors like solar-cell degradation, emissions attributed to the PV systems life-cycle, and the repowering due to the substitution of the systems after their life-time is reached. Finally, the results of this work can be of interest in energy planning policies related to the contribution of PV technologies for the decarbonization of the power generation system.}

Additionally, we review feedbacks between USSE infrastructure and land-atmosphere interactions and the potential for USSE systems to mitigate climate change. Several characteristics and development strategies of USSE systems have low environmental impacts relative to other energy systems, including other renewables. We show opportunities to increase USSE environmental co-benefits, the permitting and regulatory constraints and opportunities of USSE, and highlight future research directions to better understand the nexus between USSE and the environment. Increasing the environmental compatibility of USSE systems will maximize the efficacy of this key renewable energy source in mitigating climatic and global environmental change.}

Additionally, we used the Carnegie Energy and Environmental Compatibility model, a multiple criteria model, to quantify each installation according to environmental and technical compatibility. Last, we evaluated installations according to their proximity to protected areas, including inventoried roadless areas, endangered and threatened species habitat, and federally protected areas. We found the plurality of USSE (6,995 MW) in California is sited in shrublands and scrublands, comprising 375 km2 of land cover change. Twenty-eight percent of USSE installations are located in croplands and pastures, comprising 155 km2 of change. Less than 15\% of USSE installations are sited in ``Compatible'' areas. The majority of ``Incompatible'' USSE power plants are sited far from existing transmission infrastructure, and all USSE installations average at most 7 and 5 km from protected areas, for PV and CSP, respectively.

Here we introduce our new methodology of node-internal grid calculation representing the electricity grid in cost values based on strong correlations between peak load, grid cost and feed-in share of wind and photovoltaic capacity. We validate in our case study this approach using a 491 node model for Germany. This examination area is modelled as enclosed energy system to calculate the grid in a 100\% renewable energy system in 2050 enabling maximum grid expansion. Our grid model facilitates grid expansion cost and reduces computational effort. The quantification of the German electricity grid show that the grid makes up to 12\% of total system cost equivalent up to 12 billion {\texteuro} per year.}

A multi-criteria assessment reveals the impact of such CSP-HVDC power plants on energy infrastructure, operational behaviour, cost and emission of the energy system. To evaluate national grid expansion, a new grid methodology is used as composed of transmission and distribution grid. The evaluation shows that power plant capacity, electrical storage and grid expansion as well as electrical curtailment can cause a beneficial impact when CSP-HVDC is used to supplement the energy portfolio in Europe.}

  abstract = {The mitigation of climate change requires a near total decarbonisation of the power generation sector by 2050. Decisions on the amount of generating capacity, the types of technologies, and their operation are crucial to achieving emission targets. As power plants operate in an interconnected system, their evaluation should be based on their contribution to overall system performance as opposed to their individual costs when operating in isolation. In this contribution, we present a methodological approach for deriving the Levelised Value of Electricity (LVOE) as a new metric determining the value of a technology to the electricity system. The methodology is based on a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) which simultaneously optimises the electricity system design and operation. It considers both security of supply and environmental aspects and presents the technology value as a function of the prevalent system conditions. An illustrative study on the LVOE of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) power plants reveals how the economic deployment of CCS could reduce total system cost in the future UK energy system.}

  abstract = {We present an power systems optimisation model for national-scale power supply capacity expansion considering endogenous technology cost reduction (ESO-XEL). The mixed-integer linear program minimises total system cost while complying with operational constraints, carbon emission targets, and ancillary service requirements. A data clustering technique and the relaxation of integer scheduling constraints is evaluated and applied to decrease the model solution time. Two cost learning curves for the different power technologies are derived: one assuming local learning effects, the other accounting for global knowledge spill-over. A piece-wise linear formulation allows the integration of the exponential learning curves into the ESO-XEL model. The model is applied to the UK power system in the time frame of 2015 to 2050. The consideration of cost learning effects moves optimal investment timings to earlier planning years and influences the competitiveness of technologies. In addition, the maximum capacity build rate parameter influences the share of power generation significantly; the possibility of rapid capacity build-up is more important for total system cost reduction by 2050 than accounting for technology cost reduction.},

  abstract = {A new approach is required to determine a technology's value to the power systems of the 21st century. Conventional cost-based metrics are incapable of accounting for the indirect system costs associated with intermittent electricity generation, in addition to environmental and security constraints. In this work, we formalise a new concept for power generation and storage technology valuation which explicitly accounts for system conditions, integration challenges, and the level of technology penetration. The centrepiece of the system value (SV) concept is a whole electricity systems model on a national scale, which simultaneously determines the ideal power system design and unit-wise operational strategy. It brings typical Process Systems Engineering thinking into the analysis of power systems. The model formulation is a mixed-integer linear optimisation and can be understood as hybrid between a generation expansion and a unit commitment model. We present an analysis of the future UK electricity system and investigate the SV of carbon capture and storage equipped power plants (CCS), onshore wind power plants, and grid-level energy storage capacity. We show how the availability of different low-carbon technologies impact the optimal capacity mix and generation patterns. We find that the SV in the year 2035 of grid-level energy storage is an order of magnitude greater than that of CCS and wind power plants. However, CCS and wind capacity provide a more consistent value to the system as their level of deployment increases. Ultimately, the incremental system value of a power technology is a function of the prevalent system design and constraints.}

  abstract = {The integration of wind and solar generators into power systems causes ``integration costs'' -- for grids, balancing services, more flexible operation of thermal plants, and reduced utilization of the capital stock embodied in infrastructure, among other things. This paper proposes a framework to analyze and quantify these costs. We propose a definition of integration costs based on the marginal economic value of electricity, or market value -- as such a definition can be more easily used in economic cost-benefit assessment than previous approaches. We suggest decomposing integration costs intro three components, according to the principal characteristics of wind and solar power: temporal variability, uncertainty, and location-constraints. Quantitative estimates of these components are extracted from a review of 100~+~published studies. At high penetration rates, say a wind market share of 30--40\%, integration costs are found to be 25--35~{\texteuro}/MWh, i.e. up to 50\% of generation costs. While these estimates are system-specific and subject to significant uncertainty, integration costs are certainly too large to be ignored in high-penetration assessments (but might be ignored at low penetration). The largest single factor is reduced utilization of capital embodied in thermal plants, a cost component that has not been accounted for in most previous integration studies.}

  abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive discussion of the market value of variable renewable energy (VRE). The inherent variability of wind speeds and solar radiation affects the price that VRE generators receive on the market (market value). During windy and sunny times the additional electricity supply reduces the prices. Because the drop is larger with more installed capacity, the market value of VRE falls with higher penetration rate. This study aims to develop a better understanding on how the market value with penetration, and how policies and prices affect the market value. Quantitative evidence is derived from a review of published studies, regression analysis of market data, and the calibrated model of the European electricity market EMMA. We find the value of wind power to fall from 110\% of the average power price to 50--80\% as wind penetration increases from zero to 30\% of total electricity consumption. For solar power, similarly low value levels are reached already at 15\% penetration. Hence, competitive large-scale renewable deployment will be more difficult to accomplish than as many anticipate.}

  abstract = {Energy and climate policies are usually seen as measures to internalize externalities. However, as a side effect, the introduction of these policies redistributes wealth between consumers and producers, and within these groups. While redistribution is seldom the focus of the academic literature in energy economics, it plays a central role in public debates and policy decisions. This paper compares the distributional effects of two major electricity policies: support schemes for renewable energy sources, and CO2 pricing. We find that the redistribution effects of both policies are large, and they work in opposed directions. While renewables support transfers wealth from producers to consumers, carbon pricing does the opposite. More specifically, we show that moderate amounts of wind subsidies can increase consumer surplus, even if consumers bear the subsidy costs. CO2 pricing, in contrast, increases aggregated producer surplus, even without free allocation of emission allowances; however, not all types of producers benefit. These findings are derived from an analytical model of electricity markets, and a calibrated numerical model of Northwestern Europe. Our findings imply that if policy makers want to avoid large redistribution they might prefer a mix of policies, even if CO2 pricing alone is the first-best climate policy in terms of allocative efficiency.}

  abstract = {Previous studies find that the economic value of electricity (USD/MWh) generated by wind power drops with increasing market share. Different measures can help mitigate the value drop, including electricity storage, flexible conventional plants, expansion of transmission, and demand response. This study assesses another option: a change in design of wind power plants. ``Advanced'' wind turbines that are higher and have a larger rotor compared to rated capacity (lower specific rating) generate electricity more constantly than ``classical'' turbines. Recent years have witnessed a significant shift towards such advanced technology. Our model-based analysis for Northwestern Europe shows that such design can substantially increase the spot market value of generated electricity. At a 30\% penetration rate, the value of 1MWh of electricity generated from a fleet of advanced turbines is estimated to be 15\% higher than the value of 1MWh from classical turbines. The additional value is large, whether compared to wind generation costs, to the value drop, or to the effect of alternative measures such as electricity storage. Extensive sensitivity tests indicate that this finding is remarkably robust. The increase in bulk power value is not the only advantage of advanced turbines: additional benefits might accrue from reduced costs for power grids and balancing services. To fully realize this potential, power markets and support policies need to be appropriately designed and signal scarcity investors.}

This was done by calculating the payback time for various sizes of newly installed PV systems for a Finnish detached house with district heating. Three types of economic support schemes (guaranteed selling price, fixed premiums and self-consumption incentives) were tested in an hourly simulation. The load of the building was based on real-life measurements, while PV output was simulated with TRNSYS software. The energy results were post-processed with economic data in MATLAB to find the payback time. Hourly electricity prices from the Nordic energy market were used with PV system prices from Finnish companies. Unsubsidised residential PV systems in Finland had payback times of more than 40 years. The production-based support for PV generation needs to be two to three times the buying price of electricity, to make it possible to pay back the initial investment in 20 years. Low capacity systems with more than 50\% self-consumption (under 3 kW) were favoured by self-consumption incentives, while high capacity systems with less than 40\% self-consumption (over 5 kW) were favoured by the FIT-type support schemes.}

We calculate the profits under two scenarios (perfect and imperfect information about future electricity prices), and estimate the effect of bulk storage on net emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOx for 20 eGRID subregions in the United States. We find that net system CO2 emissions resulting from storage operation are nontrivial when compared to the emissions from electricity generation, ranging from 104 to 407 kg/MWh of delivered energy depending on location, storage operation mode, and assumptions regarding carbon intensity. Net NOx emissions range from -0.16 (i.e., producing net savings) to 0.49 kg/MWh, and are generally small when compared to average generation-related emissions.

  abstract = {The wind energy market is in full growth in Quebec but technical difficulties due to cold climate conditions have occurred for most of the existing projects. Thus, icing simulations were carried out on a 0.2 m NACA 63 415 blade profile in the refrigerated wind tunnel of the Anti-icing Materials International Laboratory (AMIL). The shapes and masses of the ice deposits were measured, as well as the lift and drag forces of the iced profiles. Scaling was carried out based on the 1.8 MW--Vestas V80 wind turbine technical data, for three different radial positions and two in-fog icing conditions measured at the Murdochville wind farm in the Gasp{\'e} Peninsula. For both icing events, the mass of ice accumulated on the blade profile increased with an increase in the radial position. In wet regime testing (first icing event), glaze formed mostly near the leading edge and on the pressure side. It also accumulated by run-off on the trailing edge of the outer half of the blade. In dry-regime testing (second icing event), rime mostly accreted on the leading edge and formed horns. For both icing events, when glaze or rime accreted on the blade profile, lift decreased and drag increased. A load calculation using the blade element theory shows that drag force on the entire blade becomes too large compared to lift, leading to a negative torque and the stop of the wind turbine. Torque reduction is more significant on the outer third of the blade. Setting up a de-icing system only on the outer part of the blade would enable significant decrease of heating energy costs.

Solar energy plays a critical role in contributing to the alternative energy mix to mitigate climate change and meet policy milestones; however, the extent that solar energy development on nonconventional surfaces can mitigate land scarcity is understudied. Here, we evaluate the land sparing potential of solar energy development across four nonconventional land-cover types: the built environment, salt-affected land, contaminated land, and water reservoirs (as floatovoltaics), within the Great Central Valley (CV, CA), a globally significant agricultural region where land for food production, urban development, and conservation collide. Furthermore, we calculate the technical potential (TWh year--1) of these land sparing sites and test the degree to which projected electricity needs for the state of California can be met therein. In total, the CV encompasses 15\% of CA, 8415 km2 of which was identified as potentially land-sparing for solar energy development. These areas comprise a capacity-based energy potential of at least 17\,348 TWh year--1 for photovoltaic (PV) and 2213 TWh year--1 for concentrating solar power (CSP). Accounting for technology efficiencies, this exceeds California's 2025 projected electricity demands up to 13 and 2 times for PV and CSP, respectively. Our study underscores the potential of strategic renewable energy siting to mitigate environmental trade-offs typically coupled with energy sprawl in agricultural landscapes.}

To overcome this problem, time series aggregation (TSA) is frequently used to reduce ESM complexity. As these methods aim at the reduction of input data and preserving the main information about the time series, but are not based on mathematically equivalent transformations, the performance of each method depends on the justifiability of its assumptions. This review systematically categorizes the TSA methods applied in 130 different publications to highlight the underlying assumptions and to evaluate the impact of these on the respective case studies. Moreover, the review analyzes current trends in TSA and formulates subjects for future research. This analysis reveals that the future of TSA is clearly feature-based including clustering and other machine learning techniques which are capable of dealing with the growing amount of input data for ESMs. Further, a growing number of publications focus on bounding the TSA induced error of the ESM optimization result. Thus, this study can be used as both an introduction to the topic and for revealing remaining research gaps.},

For this reason, published future electricity scenarios aimed at policy makers for this country have not seriously considered a full mix of energy options. Here we addressed this deficiency by comparing the life-cycle sustainability of published scenarios using multi-criteria decision-making analysis, and modeling the optimized future electricity mix using a genetic algorithm. The published `CSIRO e-future' scenario under its default condition (excluding nuclear) has the largest aggregate negative environmental and economic outcomes (score=4.51 out of 8), followed by the Australian Energy Market Operator's 100\% renewable energy scenario (4.16) and the Greenpeace scenario (3.97). The e-future projection with maximum nuclear-power penetration allowed yields the lowest negative impacts (1.46). After modeling possible future electricity mixes including or excluding nuclear power, the weighted criteria recommended an optimized scenario mix where nuclear power generated {$>$}40\% of total electricity. The life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of the optimization scenarios including nuclear power were {$<$}27kg CO2-e MWh-1 in 2050, which achieves the IPCC's target of 50--150kg CO2-e MWh-1. Our analyses demonstrate clearly that nuclear power is an effective and logical option for the environmental and economic sustainability of a future electricity network in Australia.}

To realise this potential, an area of 1.1 Gha is required when the wind turbines are installed at an average power density of 4 MW km-2. This is similar to the total global grassland area or to an area with the size of about China. The regionally highest technical potential of onshore wind energy is found for USA: 21 PWh year-1. Lowest figures are found for South East Asia, Southern and Western Africa and Japan. With present day technology, roughly an amount equal to the present (2001) world electricity consumption can be generated at a cost of 0.07 US\$ kWh-1 and below, mainly in Canada, USA, South America, OECD Europe and the former USSR.},

Hourly modelling of this system over a 10-year period shows that even in an integrated energy system there will be significant electricity surpluses and shortfalls. Flexible demand and conventional electricity and heat stores reduced the extremes but could not provide the capacity required. Carbon-neutral synthetic gaseous fuel could provide a flexible and quickly dispatchable back up system, with large storage and generation capacities comparable with those in the UK today.}

The model worked well over a wide range of temperatures, 9--38 {$^\circ$}C, making it possible to accurately forecast the electricity load for a variety of demand response applications including operational reserves for renewable energy integration. Individual models are simulated and summed to obtain aggregate forecasts and confidence intervals. The model allows for correlation between the individual shocks that occur in a region. This approach gives substantially more accurate results than the moving average method typically used for forecasting and measuring direct load control. Applying the model to data from three U.S. utilities produced mean square error values from 0.027 to 0.041 with average load values per customer ranging from 0.49 to 0.62 kW.}

The analysis employs a dynamic and discrete numerical model that takes into account what we have termed renewable energy `breeding', i.e. RE technologies are being made increasingly with renewable electricity as the transition progresses. Our results show that every scenario under investigation fails to achieve the sector's share of Australia's national carbon budget for a 1.5\,{$^\circ$}C global warming limit and around one-third fail the 2\,{$^\circ$}C target by 2050. In most of the scenarios considered, the reduction in annual life-cycle CO2e emissions in the year 2050, from taking into account the effect of RE breeding, was substantial, in some cases reducing annual emissions by more than 90\%. But, the reduction in cumulative CO2e emissions resulting from RE breeding only became significant post-2040. Unless a very rapid transition is made to more than 80\% renewable electricity in Australia well before mid-century, any positive `breeding' effect is simply dwarfed by fossil-fuel derived emissions prior to and during the actual transition. Therefore, early, decisive, wide-scale deployment of a suitable mix of RE technologies is needed to reduce cumulative emissions.}

  abstract = {Published scientific literature contains many studies estimating life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of residential and utility-scale solar photovoltaics (PVs). Despite the volume of published work, variability in results hinders generalized conclusions. Most variance between studies can be attributed to differences in methods and assumptions. To clarify the published results for use in decision making and other analyses, we conduct a meta-analysis of existing studies, harmonizing key performance characteristics to produce more comparable and consistently derived results. Screening 397 life cycle assessments (LCAs) relevant to PVs yielded 13 studies on crystalline silicon (c-Si) that met minimum standards of quality, transparency, and relevance. Prior to harmonization, the median of 42 estimates of life cycle GHG emissions from those 13 LCAs was 57 grams carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour (g CO2-eq/kWh), with an interquartile range (IQR) of 44 to 73. After harmonizing key performance characteristics (irradiation of 1,700 kilowatt-hours per square meter per year (kWh/m2/yr); system lifetime of 30 years; module efficiency of 13.2\% or 14.0\%, depending on module type; and a performance ratio of 0.75 or 0.80, depending on installation, the median estimate decreased to 45 and the IQR tightened to 39 to 49. The median estimate and variability were reduced compared to published estimates mainly because of higher average assumptions for irradiation and system lifetime. For the sample of studies evaluated, harmonization effectively reduced variability, providing a clearer synopsis of the life cycle GHG emissions from c-Si PVs. The literature used in this harmonization neither covers all possible c-Si installations nor represents the distribution of deployed or manufactured c-Si PVs.},

Achieving this goal in the United States requires a national, economy-wide transformation in energy production and use in five sectors: electricity, transportation, industry, land-based carbon sinks, and buildings. All of these sectors interact with planning for the built environment and land use, so planning scholars and practitioners have many opportunities to engage policymakers working on national-level decarbonization strategies.

  abstract = {China is one of the largest and fastest growing economies in the world. Until now, the corresponding growth of electricity consumption has been mainly provided by coal. However, as national reserves are limited and since burning coal leads to severe environmental problems, the employment of alternative sources of energy supply has become an important part of the Chinese energy policy. Recent studies show that wind energy alone could meet~all of China's electricity demand. While our results validate these findings with regard to annual production, we look at the hour-by-hour resolution and uncover a major limitation: wind generation will not match the demand at every given point in time. This results in significant periods with over- and undersupply. Our study shows that combining wind and solar generation in the power system reduces overproduction significantly and increases the capacity credit of the combined VRE (variable renewable energy sources). The article demonstrates that up to 70\% of VRE comprising 20--30\% solar generation in the form of photovoltaics (PV) can be integrated into China's electricity system with moderate storage requirements. We encourage planners to consider those findings in their long-term planning in order to set up a sustainable power system for China at low costs.}

A decarbonization of the region's electricity supply is thus a very important measure when taking action on global climate change. This paper defines cost-optimal pathways towards a sustainable power system in the region by employing linear optimization. The proposed model simultaneously optimizes the required capacities and the hourly operation of generation, transmission, and storage. The obtained results show that all different kinds of renewable sources will have to be utilized, while none of them should have a share of more than one third. The findings give reason for setting up an ASEAN power grid, as it enables the transportation of electricity from the best sites to load centers and leads to a balancing of the fluctuations from wind and solar generation. We suggest fostering a diversified extension of renewables and to elaborate on political and technical solutions that enable the build up an transnational supergrid.}

Here, we provide a detailed techno-economic evaluation and uncertainty analysis of applicable technologies and identify challenges and opportunities to support electric grid planning. We show that for a 120-h storage duration rating, hydrogen systems with geologic storage and natural gas with carbon capture are the least-cost low-carbon technologies for both current and future capital costs. These results are robust to uncertainty for the future capital cost scenario, but adiabatic compressed air and pumped thermal storage could be the least-cost technologies in the current capital cost scenario under uncertainty. Finally, we present a new storage system using heavy-duty vehicle fuel cells that could reduce the levelized cost of energy by 13\%--20\% compared with the best previously considered storage technology and, thus, could help enable very high ({$>$}80\%) renewable energy grids.}

PRIMA brings together state-of-the-art models of regional climate, hydrology, agriculture and land use, socioeconomics, and energy systems using a flexible coupling approach. Stakeholder decision support needs underpin the application of the platform to regional issues, and an uncertainty characterization process is used to identify robust decisions. The platform can be customized to inform a variety of complex questions, such as how a policy in one sector might affect the ability to meet climate mitigation targets or adaptation goals in another sector. Current numerical experiments focus on the eastern United States, but the framework is designed to be regionally flexible. This paper provides a high-level overview of PRIMA's functional capabilities and describes some key challenges and opportunities associated with integrated regional modeling.},

Conventional hydropower can be an important asset for managing variability and uncertainty in the power system, but multi-purpose reservoirs are often limited by non-power constraints. Previous large-scale variable generation integration studies have simulated the operation of the electric system under different penetration levels but often with simplified representations of hydropower to avoid complex non-power constraints. This paper illustrates the value of bridging the gap between power system models and detailed hydropower models with a demonstration case. The United States Western Interconnection is modeled with PLEXOS, and ten large reservoirs on the Columbia River are modeled with RiverWare. The results show the effect of detailed hydropower modeling on the power system and its benefits to the power system, such as the decrease in overall production cost and the reduction of variable generation curtailment.}

We model the impact of natural gas prices, increased Canadian hydropower deployment, and increased renewable energy (RE) penetrations. The sample results analyzed in this paper show the highly dynamic nature of the modeling tool as it performs a simultaneous optimization of the two countries' generation portfolios. The interactions between the two countries go beyond energy generation and also include firm capacity contracts and renewable energy certificates (RECs). The reference scenario results show a significant increase in wind generation in both the United States and Canada with a gradual retirement of coal and nuclear energy. The evolution of net energy and firm capacity exchange was very dynamic through the span of the analysis period and drives significant investment in transmission capacity across the border, almost doubling the existing capacity of transmission lines. The exchange of energy was driven by regional stories. ISO-NE and NYISO import energy throughout the analysis period. However, in the Western Interconnection we observed increasing imports to Canada from the United States, whereas the exchanges with MISO switched directions.}

Here we study the North European power and district heat system with alternative long-term storage, the power-to-ammonia (P2A) technology. Assuming fully renewable power and heat sectors and large-scale electrification of road transport, we perform simultaneous optimization of capacity investments and dispatch scheduling of wind, solar, hydro and thermal power, energy storages as well as transmission, focusing on year 2050. We find that P2A has three major roles: it provides renewable feedstock to fertilizer industry and it contributes significantly to system balancing over both time (energy storage) and space (energy transfer). The marginal cost of power-based ammonia production in the studied scenarios varied between 431 and 528 {\texteuro}/t, which is in the range of recent ammonia prices. Costs of P2A plants were dominated by electrolysis. In the power and heat sector, with our cost assumptions, P2A becomes competitive compared to fossil natural gas only if gas price or CO2 emission price rises above 70~{\texteuro}/MWh or 200 {\texteuro}/tCO2.}

This special report is the world's first comprehensive study of how to transition to a net zero energy system by 2050 while ensuring stable and affordable energy supplies, providing universal energy access, and enabling robust economic growth. It sets out a cost-effective and economically productive pathway, resulting in a clean, dynamic and resilient energy economy dominated by renewables like solar and wind instead of fossil fuels. The report also examines key uncertainties, such as the roles of bioenergy, carbon capture and behavioural changes in reaching net zero.}

Hurricanes in the Caribbean present a significant challenge to the continuity of the electric service. In this paper we present a case study of residential system resiliency with the adaptation of an existing residential photovoltaic system in Puerto Rico, grid-tied under a net metering agreement with the utility, to a stand-alone system with batteries to provide continuity of service after Hurricane Mar{\'i}a. Then, we present and analyze recorded data of the electric demand behavior and essential loads behavior at the residence prior to Hurricane Mar{\'i}a, when the residence was connected to the functioning electric grid at full load, and after Hurricane Maria when the residence was operating disconnected from the electric grid with diminished electric demand. Furthermore, we perform an economic analysis between the PV system and an equivalent gasoline inverter generator. Our analysis serves as a feasibility study of the use of stand-alone photovoltaic systems to increase residential resiliency in Caribbean islands after a hurricane.},

  abstract = {Stabilizing the global climate will require large-scale global deployment of low-carbon technologies. Even in the presence of aggressive climate policies, however, the diffusion of such technologies may be limited by several institutional, behavioral, and social factors. In this paper, we review the literature on the sources of such diffusion constraints, and explore the potential implications of such constraints based on the GCAM integrated assessment model. Our analysis highlights that factors that limit technology deployment may have sizeable impacts on the feasibility and mitigation costs of achieving stringent stabilization targets. And such impacts are greatly amplified with major delays in serious climate policies. The results generally indicate that constraints on the expansions of CCS and renewables are more costly than those on nuclear or bioenergy, and jointly constraining these technologies leaves some scenarios infeasible.}

  abstract = {This study presents roadmaps for each of the 50 United States to convert their all-purpose energy systems (for electricity, transportation, heating/cooling, and industry) to ones powered entirely by wind, water, and sunlight (WWS). The plans contemplate 80--85\% of existing energy replaced by 2030 and 100\% replaced by 2050. Conversion would reduce each state's end-use power demand by a mean of {$\sim$}39.3\% with {$\sim$}82.4\% of this due to the efficiency of electrification and the rest due to end-use energy efficiency improvements. Year 2050 end-use U.S. all-purpose load would be met with {$\sim$}30.9\% onshore wind, {$\sim$}19.1\% offshore wind, {$\sim$}30.7\% utility-scale photovoltaics (PV), {$\sim$}7.2\% rooftop PV, {$\sim$}7.3\% concentrated solar power (CSP) with storage, {$\sim$}1.25\% geothermal power, {$\sim$}0.37\% wave power, {$\sim$}0.14\% tidal power, and {$\sim$}3.01\% hydroelectric power. Based on a parallel grid integration study, an additional 4.4\% and 7.2\% of power beyond that needed for annual loads would be supplied by CSP with storage and solar thermal for heat, respectively, for peaking and grid stability. Over all 50 states, converting would provide {$\sim$}3.9 million 40-year construction jobs and {$\sim$}2.0 million 40-year operation jobs for the energy facilities alone, the sum of which would outweigh the {$\sim$}3.9 million jobs lost in the conventional energy sector. Converting would also eliminate {$\sim$}62000 (19000--115000) U.S. air pollution premature mortalities per year today and {$\sim$}46000 (12000--104000) in 2050, avoiding {$\sim\$$}600 (\$85--\$2400) bil. per year (2013 dollars) in 2050, equivalent to {$\sim$}3.6 (0.5--14.3) percent of the 2014 U.S. gross domestic product. Converting would further eliminate {$\sim\$$}3.3 (1.9--7.1) tril. per year in 2050 global warming costs to the world due to U.S. emissions. These plans will result in each person in the U.S. in 2050 saving {$\sim\$$}260 (190--320) per year in energy costs (\$2013 dollars) and U.S. health and global climate costs per person decreasing by {$\sim\$$}1500 (210--6000) per year and {$\sim\$$}8300 (4700--17600) per year, respectively. The new footprint over land required will be {$\sim$}0.42\% of U.S. land. The spacing area between wind turbines, which can be used for multiple purposes, will be {$\sim$}1.6\% of U.S. land. Thus, 100\% conversions are technically and economically feasible with little downside. These roadmaps may therefore reduce social and political barriers to implementing clean-energy policies.},

The roadmaps envision 80\% conversion by 2030 and 100\% by 2050. WWS not only replaces business-as-usual (BAU) power, but also reduces it {$\sim$}42.5\% because the work: energy ratio of WWS electricity exceeds that of combustion (23.0\%), WWS requires no mining, transporting, or processing of fuels (12.6\%), and WWS end-use efficiency is assumed to exceed that of BAU (6.9\%). Converting may create {$\sim$}24.3 million more permanent, full-time jobs than jobs lost. It~may avoid {$\sim$}4.6 million/year premature air-pollution deaths today and {$\sim$}3.5~million/year in 2050; {$\sim\$$}22.8 trillion/year (12.7 ¢/kWh-BAU-all-energy) in 2050 air-pollution costs; and {$\sim\$$}28.5 trillion/year (15.8 ¢/kWh-BAU-all-energy) in 2050 climate costs. Transitioning should also stabilize energy prices because fuel costs are zero, reduce power disruption and increase access to energy by decentralizing power, and avoid 1.5{$^\circ$}C global warming.}

Wind HFCVs should benefit climate most. An all-HFCV fleet would hardly affect tropospheric water vapor concentrations. Conversion to coal HFCVs may improve health but would damage climate more than fossil/electric hybrids. The real cost of hydrogen from wind electrolysis may be below that of U.S. gasoline.

The caveat of this success is that conventional designs depend on high density, low-cost biomass with no disruption from incremental weather.

  abstract = {This study addresses the greatest concern facing the large-scale integration of wind, water, and solar (WWS) into a power grid: the high cost of avoiding load loss caused by WWS variability and uncertainty. It uses a new grid integration model and finds low-cost, no-load-loss, nonunique solutions to this problem on electrification of all US energy sectors (electricity, transportation, heating/cooling, and industry) while accounting for wind and solar time series data from a 3D global weather model that simulates extreme events and competition among wind turbines for available kinetic energy. Solutions are obtained by prioritizing storage for heat (in soil and water); cold (in ice and water); and electricity (in phase-change materials, pumped hydro, hydropower, and hydrogen), and using demand response. No natural gas, biofuels, nuclear power, or stationary batteries are needed. The resulting 2050--2055 US electricity social cost for a full system is much less than for fossil fuels. These results hold for many conditions, suggesting that low-cost, reliable 100\% WWS systems should work many places worldwide.},

  abstract = {Matching electricity, heat, and cold demand with supply at low cost is the greatest concern facing countries seeking to provide their all-purpose energy with 100\% clean, renewable wind, water, and sunlight (WWS). Implementing WWS worldwide could eliminate 4e7 million annual air pollution deaths, first slow then reverse global warming, and provide energy sustainably. This study derives zero-load-loss technical solutions to matching demand with 100\% WWS supply; heat, cold, and electricity storage; hydrogen production; assumed all-distance transmission; and demand response for 20 world regions encompassing 139 countries after they electrify or provide direct heat for all energy in 2050. Multiple solutions are found, including those with batteries and heat pumps but zero added hydropower turbines and zero thermal energy storage. Whereas WWS and Business-As-Usual (BAU) energy costs per unit energy are similar, WWS requires {\textasciitilde}42.5\% less energy in a base case and {\textasciitilde}57.9\% less in a heat-pump case so may reduce capital and consumer costs significantly. Further, WWS social (energy {\th} health {\th} climate) costs per unit energy are one-fourth BAU's. By reducing water vapor, the wind turbines proposed may rapidly offset {\textasciitilde}3\% global warming while also displacing fossil-fuel emissions. Thus, with careful planning, the world's energy challenges may be solvable with a practical technique.},

California's available WWS resources are first evaluated. A mix of WWS generators is then proposed to match projected 2050 electric power demand after all sectors have been electrified. The plan contemplates all new energy from WWS by 2020, 80--85\% of existing energy converted by 2030, and 100\% by 2050. Electrification plus modest efficiency measures may reduce California's end-use power demand {$\sim$}44\% and stabilize energy prices since WWS fuel costs are zero. Several methods discussed should help generation to match demand. A complete conversion in California by 2050 is estimated to create {$\sim$}220,000 more 40-year jobs than lost, eliminate {$\sim$}12,500 (3800--23,200) state air-pollution premature mortalities/yr, avoid \$103 (31--232) billion/yr in health costs, representing 4.9 (1.5--11.2)\% of California's 2012 gross domestic product, and reduce California's 2050 global climate cost contribution by \$48 billion/yr. The California air-pollution health plus global climate cost benefits from eliminating California emissions could equal the \$1.1 trillion installation cost of 603~GW of new power needed for a 100\% all-purpose WWS system within {$\sim$}7 (4--14) years.}

  abstract = {To date, roadmaps and policies for transitioning from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy have been developed for nations, provinces, states, cities, and towns in order to address air pollution, global warming, and energy insecurity. However, neither roadmaps nor policies have been developed for large metropolitan areas (aggregations of towns and cities), including megacities (metropolitan areas with populations above 10 million). This study bridges that gap by developing roadmaps to transition 74 metropolitan areas worldwide, including 30 megacities, to 100\% wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) energy and storage for all energy sectors by no later than 2050, with at least 80\% by 2030. Among all metropolitan areas examined, the full transition may reduce 2050 annual energy costs by 61.1\% (from \$2.2 to \$0.86 trillion/yr in 2013 USD) and social costs (energy plus air pollution plus climate costs) by 89.6\% (from \$8.3 to \$0.86 trillion/yr). The large energy cost reduction is due to the 57.1\% lower end-used energy requirements and the 9\% lower cost per unit energy with WWS. The air pollution cost reduction of {\textasciitilde}\$2.6 (1.5--4.6) trillion/yr is due mostly to the saving of 408,000 (322,000--506,000) lives/yr with WWS. Global climate cost savings due to WWS are {\textasciitilde}\$3.5 (2.0--7.5) trillion/yr (2013 USD). The transition may also create {\textasciitilde}1.4 million more long-term, full-time jobs than lost. Thus, moving to 100\% clean, renewable energy and storage for all purposes in metropolitan areas can result in significant economic, health, climate, and job benefits.},

Grid stability is analyzed in five regions; six isolated states (Texas, California, Florida, New York, Alaska, Hawaii); Texas interconnected with the Midwest, and the contiguous U.S. No blackouts occur, including during summer in California or winter in Texas. No batteries with over 4-h storage are needed. Concatenating 4-h batteries provides long-duration storage. Whereas transitioning more than doubles electricity use, it reduces total end-use energy demand by {$\sim$}57\% versus business-as-usual (BAU), contributing to the 63 (43--79)\% and 86 (77--90)\% lower annual private and social (private~+~health~+~climate) energy costs, respectively, than BAU. Costs per unit energy in California, New York, and Texas are 11\%, 21\%, and 27\% lower, respectively, and in Florida are 1.5\% higher, when these states are interconnected regionally rather than islanded.

A deep decarbonization of the power sector is integral to achieving any meaningful target; energy storage systems (ESSs) have emerged as a frontrunner in addressing some of the challenges facing a transition towards renewables-based power supply. Here we document a systems-level review of over 100 relevant studies to underline key takeaways on the role of ESSs and highlight research gaps. We find a) most decarbonization studies investigating the role of ESSs do not consider ambitious emissions targets like the intergovernmental panel on climate change's (IPCC's) goal to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5~{$^\circ$}C, b) the role of ESSs in low-carbon electricity pathways rely heavily on local contexts (such as decarbonization policy etc.) c) from a technology perspective, duration and capital cost are the main factors in assessing the viability of each ESS technology; the dominant role for short-duration storage (e.g., batteries) is solar energy integration and partially replacing peaker plants, mid-duration storage (e.g., flow batteries, PHES) contributes to wind energy integration and in decreasing variable renewable energy (VRE) curtailments, while long-duration storage (e.g., CAES, P2G, hydrogen) provides long-term (seasonal) energy shifts, d) virtual ESS solutions can provide similar flexibility without high hardware investment requirements but rather through improved algorithms for optimization, control and measurements, and e) planning models that do not account for the technical characteristics of ESS technologies are inadequate to assess technology tradeoffs.},

  abstract = {Decarbonization of the electricity sector is one of the major measures in slowing down the pace of climate change. In this paper, we analyze the impacts of energy storage systems (ESS) and year-to-year variability and uncertainty in the hourly profiles of variable renewable energy (VRE) on power system decarbonization in 2050. We perform this analysis through capacity expansion optimization based on technology cost projections and CO2 emission restrictions based on 11 years of wind, solar, and load data variations in Italy's power system, with a particular focus on how ESS changes the optimal generation portfolio and system performance. We also explore the impact of ESS duration on the renewables' adoption and system costs. To quantify the impact of VRE variability in different years, we present a comparative analysis of capacity expansion optimization based on multiple-year and single-year data. Our results indicate a high RES penetration even in the absence of decarbonization policies, due to expected declines in future technology costs. In the transition to a zero-carbon electricity system, carbon capture and storage (CCS) with less than 100\% carbon capture efficiency will play a role only in intermediate low-emission scenarios unless future technology advancements improve its capture efficiency. ESS investments contribute to lower total system costs by replacing more expensive flexibility resources. However, the value of ESS changes by its duration, with longer ESS durations having lower marginal value per added kWh storage capacity. Variability in VRE profiles leads to substantial variation in the system's configuration and energy cost, depending on what year is used in the optimization. Decision making based on single-year data can therefore lead to substantial increases in the systems' operational costs in other years due to increased probability of capacity shortages and load curtailments. In contrast, optimizing over multiple VRE and load years provides a more robust and cost-effective generation expansion strategy.},

  abstract = {The European Union aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80--95\% in 2050 compared to 1990 levels. The transition towards a low-carbon economy implies the almost complete decarbonization of Europe's power sector, which could be achieved along various pathways. In this paper, we evaluate the economic implications of alternative energy policies for Europe's power sector by applying a linear dynamic electricity system optimization model in over 36 scenarios. We find that the costs of decarbonizing Europe's power sector by 2050 vary between 139 and 633 bn {\texteuro}2010, which corresponds to an increase of between 11\% and 44\% compared to the total system costs when no CO2 reduction targets are implemented. In line with economic theory, the decarbonization of Europe's power sector is achieved at minimal costs under a stand-alone CO2 reduction target, which ensures competition between all low-carbon technologies. If, however, renewable energies are exempted from competition via supplementary renewable energy (RES-E) targets or if investments in new nuclear and CCS power plants are politically restricted, the costs of decarbonization significantly rise. Moreover, we find that the excess costs of supplementary RES-E targets depend on the acceptance of alternative low carbon technologies. For example, given a complete nuclear phase-out in Europe by 2050 and politically implemented restrictions on the application of CCS to conventional power plants, supplementary RES-E targets are redundant. While in such a scenario the overall costs of decarbonization are comparatively high, the excess costs of supplementary RES-E targets are close to zero.}

It estimates the impact of temperature change on heating and cooling degree days, electricity demand, and generating unit output and efficiency. These effects are then integrated into a dispatch and capacity planning model to estimate impacts on investment decisions, emissions, system costs, and power prices for 32 U.S. regions. Without mitigation actions, total annual electricity production costs in 2050 are projected to increase 14\% (\$51 billion) because of greater cooling demand as compared to a control scenario without future temperature changes. For a scenario with global emissions mitigation, including a reduction in U.S. power sector emissions of 36\% below 2005 levels in 2050, the increase in total annual electricity production costs is approximately the same as the increase in system costs to satisfy the increased demand associated with unmitigated rising temperatures.}

However, there is no study that comprehensively analyses the effect of spatial resolution. This paper addresses this gap by applying the Heat Infrastructure and Technology heat decarbonisation optimisation model in six UK Local Authorities representing a range of rural/urban areas, at three levels of spatial resolution, in order to systematically compare results. Results show the importance of spatial resolution for optimal allocation of heat supply technologies and infrastructure across different urban/rural areas. Firstly, for the studied cases, differences of up to 30\% in heat network uptake were observed when comparing results between different resolutions for a given area. Secondly, for areas that generally exhibit the high and low extremes of linear heat density, results are less dependent on spatial resolution. Also, spatial resolution effects are more significant when there is higher variability of linear heat density throughout zones. Finally, results show that it is important to use finer resolutions when using optimisation models to inform detailed network planning and expansion. Higher spatial resolutions provide more detailed information on zones that act as anchors that can seed network growth and on location of network supply technologies.},

Colorado is the 11th windiest state and has more than 250 sunny days per year. The objectives of this research are to: 1) determine which landcover classes are affiliated with high wind and solar potential; and 2) identify areas that are suitable for wind and solar farms using multicriteria GIS modelling techniques. Renewable potential (NREL wind speed measurements at 50~m above the ground and NREL annual insolation data), landcover, population density, federal lands, and distance to roads, transmission lines, and cities were reclassified according to their suitability. Each was assigned weights based on their relative importance to one another. Superb wind classes are located in high alpine areas. Unfortunately, these areas are not suitable for large-scale wind farm development due to their inaccessibility and location within a sensitive ecosystem. Federal lands have low wind potential. According to the GIS model, ideal areas for wind farm development are located in northeastern Colorado. About 41~850~km2 of the state has model scores that are in the 90--100\% range. Although annual solar radiation varies slightly, inter-mountain areas receive the most insolation. As far as federal lands, Indian reservations have the greatest solar input. The GIS model indicates that ideal areas for solar development are located in northwestern Colorado and east of Denver. Only 191~km2 of the state had model scores that were in the 90--100\% range. These results suggest that the variables used in this analysis have more of an effect at eliminating non-suitable areas for large-scale solar farms; a greater area exists for suitable wind farms. However, given the statewide high insolation values with minimal variance, solar projects may be better suited for small-scale residential or commercial projects.}

In this article, we develop an optimization model for the integrated generation and transmission system in the continental U.S. and use it to explore electricity infrastructure pathways from the present through 2050. By comparing and contrasting results from numerous scenarios and sensitivity settings, we ultimately affirm five key policy-relevant insights. (1) U.S. electricity can be substantially decarbonized at modest cost, but complete decarbonization is very costly. (2) Significant expansion of solar PV and wind to combine for at least 40\% of the generation mix by 2050 is fairly certain, although solar PV and battery storage are more affected by economic and policy assumptions than wind. (3) Investments in long-distance transmission are very limited, while investments in battery storage are much greater, under a wide range of assumptions. (4) Optimal solutions include large investments in natural gas capacity, but gas capacity utilization rates decline steadily and significantly. (5) Cost structures shift away from operating expenditures and toward capital expenditures, especially under climate policy. We conclude our article by discussing the policy implications of these findings.},

  abstract = {With the shale gas revolution, coal retirements, environmental regulations, and increasing renewable energy resources, the interdependency of natural gas and electricity has grown significantly. Interdependency challenges, such as mismatched market schedules and disparate market operations, require quantitative modeling in order to garner insights into the effectiveness of various solutions. In this paper, a quantitative model with a dynamic market mechanism is proposed to evaluate the effects of the fuel uncertainty of natural gas-fired power plants on Social Welfare. The results of the model show that as fuel uncertainty increases, Social Welfare decreases in a nonlinear manner, with an increasing slope at higher levels of uncertainty. The model also shows that the effect of market mismatch can be mitigated with increase in the level of Demand Response.}

The transition will require combined backup from conventional sources and storage. A phase transition emerges during the ramp-up of the required amount of storage, with renewable penetration being the control parameter and average relative storage filling level being the order parameter. A singularity appears for the required storage energy capacity at a renewable penetration determined by the parameters of the storage. For an ideal storage with no roundtrip losses the transition occurs at 100\% renewable penetration. Moreover, the required storage energy capacity is strongly enhanced by temporal correlations on the synoptic weather time scale. A Markov process is proposed, which reproduces these findings.},

Further cost reductions are expected to enable substantially greater solar deployment, and new Department of Energy cost targets for utility-scale photovoltaics (PV) and concentrating solar thermal power are \$0.03/kW h and \$0.05/kW h by 2030, respectively. However, cost reductions are no longer the only significant challenge for PV---addressing grid integration challenges and increasing grid flexibility are critical as the penetration of PV electricity on the grid increases.

Intensifying storms, droughts, extreme precipitation, wildfires, higher temperatures, and sea-level rise threaten supply disruptions and facility damage. Approximately 64 percent of installed capacity commenced operation between thirty and forty-eight years ago, before climate change was considered in plant design or construction. Globally, 516 million people reside within a fifty mile (80 km) radius of at least one operating nuclear power plant, and 20 million reside within a ten mile (16 km) radius, and could face health and safety risks resulting from an extreme event induced by climate change. Roughly 41 percent of nuclear power plants operate near seacoasts, making them vulnerable to increasing storm intensity and sea-level rise. Inland plants face exposure to other climate risks, such as increasingly severe wildfires and warmer water temperatures. No entity has responsibility for conducting risk assessments that adequately evaluate the climate vulnerabilities of nuclear power and the subsequent threats to international energy security, the environment, and human health. A comprehensive risk assessment by international agencies and the development of national and international standards is necessary to mitigate risks for new and existing plants.}

  abstract = {High levels of energy from variable generation sources such as wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) can result in significant curtailment, in which the wind and PV energy cannot be used to serve demand. Adding transmission and energy storage can assist in reducing renewable curtailment, but the relative merits of each enabling technology individually or combined is not well understood. Thus, we compare the role of transmission and storage in reducing curtailment, as well as reducing generation costs from conventional sources. Using a high-fidelity model of the electric power grid, we examine a scenario in which the western portion of the U.S. and Canada reaches 37\% energy from wind and 12\% energy from solar PV. In the case studied, we find that transmission is generally more effective than energy storage in reducing curtailment, due to the curtailment patterns of wind. However, the interaction between transmission and energy storage shows that the two technologies act symbiotically, meaning that their combined energy value is greater than that of each individually. This analysis demonstrates that fully realizing the benefits of wind resources located far from demand centers will require an effective method to deliver wind power at the right times to the right locations.}

CC is an important metric widely used for resource planning and resource adequacy assessments. However, there are multiple methods for computing and estimating CC, depending on specific needs, access to data, and computational burden. It is unclear the extent to which the CC computation method may influence the result. To address this, we use a probabilistic resource adequacy tool and multiple approximation methods to systematically assess the CC of wind for near-term wind deployment under a case study in Texas. We find that proper consideration of transmission constraints is important; some approximation methods may overestimate the CC of wind due to a lack of consideration of transmission constraints, while other approximation methods may underestimate the CC by not capturing the ability of wind to be shipped to neighboring regions. In this case study, we find that several approximation methods do come close to the CC calculated by more robust probabilistic methods. However, the best approximation method may vary on a case-by-case basis, depending on system-specific considerations.},

  abstract = {In Germany, the installed capacity of renewable energy sources, especially that of wind and photovoltaic energy, has increased over the past few years and will continue to increase in the future. Due to errors in forecasting wind and photovoltaic energy, the control reserve needed to balance the electricity system will correspondingly increase if control reserves will be sized statically for several months or one year as it is done in most countries today [1], [2], [3]. That is because sizing control reserves this way does not consider the fact that there will be hours with a high penetration of wind and photovoltaic which cause a different demand for control reserves than hours with a lower penetration. Therefore, in this work, we present a new probabilistic dynamic method that sizes control reserves for the single hours of the following day making use of forecasts of the power feed-in of wind and photovoltaic. In contrast to similar approaches [2], [3] forecast errors of wind and photovoltaic power are not modeled as normal distributions, which does not reflect reality [4], [5], [6], but by kernel density estimation to get more realistic distributions. Under a 100\% renewable energy scenario for Germany, the control reserve that would be allocated by the dynamic method is compared with the control reserve that would be allocated by a static method. The static method is similar to the probabilistic Graf-Haubrich method, which is applied in Germany today, but can, in contrast to this method, be applied to future scenarios. It is shown that the dynamic method halves the average required control reserve.}

However, the weather and climate driven energy sources are characterized by a significant spatial and temporal variability. One of the commonly mentioned solutions to overcome the mismatch between demand and supply provided by renewable generation is a hybridization of two or more energy sources into a single power station (like wind-solar, solar-hydro or solar-wind-hydro). The operation of hybrid energy sources is based on the complementary nature of renewable sources. Considering the growing importance of such systems and increasing number of research activities in this area this paper presents a comprehensive review of studies which investigated, analyzed, quantified and utilized the effect of temporal, spatial and spatiotemporal complementarity between renewable energy sources. The review starts with a brief overview of available research papers, formulates detailed definition of major concepts, summarizes current research directions and ends with prospective future research activities.

  abstract = {The application of the classical forecasting methods, when applied to a fast developing utility with a period characterized by fast and dynamic changes, are insufficient and may provide an invaluable dimension to the decision making process. In this paper, a knowledge-based expert system (ES) is implemented to support the choice of the most suitable load forecasting model for medium/long term power system planning. In the proposed ES, the detailed problem statement including forecasting algorithms and the key variables (electrical and nonelectrical variables) that affect the demand forecasts are firstly identified. A set of decision rules relating these variables are then obtained and stored in the knowledge base. Afterwards, the best model that will reflect accurately the typical system behavior over other models is suggested to produce the annual load forecast. A practical application is given to demonstrate the usefulness of the developed prototype system}

  abstract = {The concept of renewable energy sources complementarity has attracted the attention of researchers across the globe over recent years. Studies have been published regularly with focuses on aspects such as new metrics for complementarity assessment, the optimal operation of hybrid power systems based on variable renewables, or mapping resources complementarity in a specific region. This study targets the present literature gap, namely a lack of complementarity study covering explicitly the whole World, based on the same data source and methodology. The research employs Kendall's Tau correlation as the complementarity metric between global solar and wind resources and a pair of indicators such as the solar share and a sizing coefficient usually applied in the domain of hybrid generators. This method allows to conduct a preliminary estimation of a solar and wind energy hybrid generator based on a daily demand of 1 kWh. The data series employed in this study come from NASA's POWER Project Program, covering the years 2001--2020. This work provides an interesting insight into the global variability of the complementarity between these two variable energy sources. Significant findings of this paper include that Kendall's Tau ranges between --0.75 and 0.75, in line with previous research for specific regions, thus providing a theoretical maximum for planning. Additionally, the results suggest that in most tropical and subtropical areas, the hybrid solar-wind generator should be dominated by the solar portion to minimize the variability of the total daily energy produced.}

As a consequence, transmission lines may become constrained. To accommodate load growth or distributed generation connections, one option is to operate existing transmission facilities up to their actual physical capacity rather than a conservative estimate of line capacity. Dynamic thermal rating of transmission lines provides actual current-carrying capacity of overhead lines based on real-time operating conditions. Dynamic Thermal Line Rating (DTLR) approaches vary significantly from one study to another in implementation, objectives and outcomes. Existing literature has presented several methodologies for DTLR adoption. This paper provides a comprehensive study of the literature on DTLR. It presents a survey and evaluation of various DTLR technologies, DTLR equipment, challenges with DTLR deployment, real world applications, and future approaches to DTLR implementation.

Slope, proximity to electric substations, protected lands, and soil quality were used as criteria to develop land suitability scenarios. 40\% of present USSE capacity has been developed on agricultural lands, and 84\% of identified land suitable for future USSE development ({$\sim$}140~GW potential) is agricultural. The USSE potential on non-agricultural land is 22.5~GW -- just sufficient to accommodate the development of 21.6~GW, which is the estimated USSE capacity that will be required to achieve NYS's 2030 goal of 70\% renewable electricity. Thus, agricultural lands will be the prime target for future USSE development. Exploring the state-specific synergies for solar-agriculture colocation, preventing the spatially-concentrated development of USSE, and incentivizing the use of unproductive agricultural lands will help mitigate negative impacts of USSE development on agricultural lands.}

  abstract = {We discuss methods for net load forecasting and their significance for operation and management of power grids with high renewable energy penetration. Net load forecasting is an enabling technology for the integration of microgrid fleets with the macrogrid. Net load represents the load that is traded between the grids (microgrid and utility grid). It is important for resource allocation and electricity market participation at the point of common coupling between the interconnected grids. We compare two inherently different approaches: additive and integrated net load forecast models. The proposed methodologies are validated on a microgrid with 33\% annual renewable energy (solar) penetration. A heuristics based solar forecasting technique is proposed, achieving skill of 24.20\%. The integrated solar and load forecasting model outperforms the additive model by 10.69\% and the uncertainty range for the additive model is larger than the integrated model by 2.2\%. Thus, for grid applications an integrated forecast model is recommended. We find that the net load forecast errors and the solar forecasting errors are cointegrated with a common stochastic drift. This is useful for future planning and modeling because the solar energy time-series allows to infer important features of the net load time-series, such as expected variability and uncertainty.}

  abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) module costs have declined rapidly over forty years but the reasons remain elusive. Here we advance a conceptual framework and quantitative method for quantifying the causes of cost changes in a technology, and apply it to PV modules. Our method begins with a cost model that breaks down cost into variables that changed over time. Cost change equations are then derived to quantify each variable's contribution. We distinguish between changes observed in variables of the cost model -- which we term low-level mechanisms of cost reduction -- and research and development, learning-by-doing, and scale economies, which we refer to as high-level mechanisms. We find that increased module efficiency was the leading low-level cause of cost reduction in 1980--2012, contributing almost 25\% of the decline. Government-funded and private R\&D was the most important high-level mechanism over this period. After 2001, however, scale economies became a more significant cause of cost reduction, approaching R\&D in importance. Policies that stimulate market growth have played a key role in enabling PV's cost reduction, through privately-funded R\&D and scale economies, and to a lesser extent learning-by-doing. The method presented here can be adapted to retrospectively or prospectively study many technologies, and performance metrics besides cost.}

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) historically have experienced problems accessing care and adverse outcomes during disasters. Study Design Retrospective cohort study with 2 comparison groups. Setting \& Participants Using Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services claims data, we assessed the frequency of early dialysis, emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and 30-day mortality for patients with ESRD in Sandy-affected areas (study group) and 2 comparison groups: (1) patients with ESRD living in states unaffected by Sandy during the same period and (2) patients with ESRD living in the Sandy-affected region a year prior to the hurricane (October 1, 2011, through October 30, 2011). Factor Regional variation in dialysis care patterns and mortality for patients with ESRD in New York City and the State of New Jersey. Measurements Frequency of early dialysis, ED visits, hospitalizations, and 30-day mortality. Results Of 13,264 study patients, 59\% received early dialysis in 70\% of the New York City and New Jersey dialysis facilities. The ED visit rate was 4.1\% for the study group compared with 2.6\% and 1.7\%, respectively, for comparison groups 1 and 2 (both P{$<$}0.001). The hospitalization rate for the study group also was significantly higher than that in either comparison group (4.5\% vs 3.2\% and 3.8\%, respectively; P{$<$}0.001 and P{$<$}0.003). 23\% of study group patients who visited the ED received dialysis in the ED compared with 9.3\% and 6.3\% in comparison groups 1 and 2, respectively (both P{$<$}0.001). The 30-day mortality rate for the study group was slightly higher than that for either comparison group (1.83\% vs 1.47\% and 1.60\%, respectively; P{$<$}0.001 and P=0.1). Limitations Lack of facility level damage and disaster-induced power outage severity data. Conclusions Nearly half the study group patients received early dialysis prior to Sandy's landfall. Poststorm increases in ED visits, hospitalizations, and 30-day mortality were found in the study group, but not in the comparison groups.}

This paper contributes to a more complete understanding of transmission's value, cost-effectiveness, and market barriers. By studying wholesale energy market prices in the United States during 2012-2022, we find that additional transfer capacity between regions was especially valuable (median of \$116M/GW-year) and directionally balanced. Transmission's market value was highly influenced by a small fraction of time: 5\% of hours typically capture at least 45\% of value. These peak periods were driven primarily by unforeseen changes in conditions within one day of operations. Transmission infrastructure cost estimates were less than market values for most studied locations, including all links crossing regional seams where value-to-cost ratios were frequently above 4, suggesting barriers to the development of valuable infrastructure. These results complement forward-looking modeling studies and aid efforts to improve modeling practices.},

  abstract = {World wind power resources are abundant, but their utilization could be limited because wind fluctuates rather than providing steady power. We hypothesize that wind power output could be stabilized if wind generators were located in a meteorologically designed configuration and electrically connected. Based on 5~yr of wind data from 11 meteorological stations, distributed over a 2,500~km extent along the U.S. East Coast, power output for each hour at each site is calculated. Each individual wind power generation site exhibits the expected power ups and downs. But when we simulate a power line connecting them, called here the Atlantic Transmission Grid, the output from the entire set of generators rarely reaches either low or full power, and power changes slowly. Notably, during the 5-yr study period, the amount of power shifted up and down but never stopped. This finding is explained by examining in detail the high and low output periods, using reanalysis data to show the weather phenomena responsible for steady production and for the occasional periods of low power. We conclude with suggested institutions appropriate to create and manage the power system analyzed here.},

Our model produces various scenarios for how electricity generation from renewables in the southern states of the U.S. can be ramped up in the next four decades. The maximum renewable potential of each state is determined for solar photovoltaic, wind, biomass, and geothermal resources. The penetration of renewables in the electricity sector is then modeled using the triangular distribution function. The renewable target is set to be a percentage of the maximum renewable potential of each state in each region. Our model accounts for a 1 \% annual increase in electricity demand in all southern states. We have produced various forecast scenarios in which the states in the three regions set their renewable target at 60, 80, and 100 \% of their maximum renewable potential in wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal. Our results show that when the renewable is set at 60 \% of the maximum renewable potential to be reached by 2050, the South Central region will be able to produce its entire electricity demand from its renewable resources by the year 2017, beyond which, further utilization of its vast renewable resources will result in significant surplus of electricity generation. At such target level, the Southwest region will be able to produce its entire demand by the year 2031, while the Southeast region will never be able to achieve the goal of 100 \% renewable electricity. Our results also indicate that when the renewable target is set at 100 \% of the maximum renewable potential, the year by which the regions are able to produce 100 \% of their electricity demands from renewable resources will be 2016, and 2024, for South Central and Southwest regions, respectively. The Southeast region, however, will remain fossil fuel-dependent even at 100 \% of its maximum renewable potential.},

While the Long Term Energy Strategy for the period 2009--2025 devised by the Government of Mauritius sets pathways for the future in a sustainable manner, it does not evaluate the feasibility of the options that will help in supporting this transition. Its scope is limited as the proposed framework aims at achieving only 35\% self-sufficiency in terms of electricity supply by 2025 against 20\% currently. This paper explores the main building blocks of a new energy paradigm by extending the analysis to 2050 in view of identifying systemic and holistic policies and strategies that will pave the way to a clean and efficient energy supply. Most notably, we look beyond electricity only to assess the energy system comprehensively in terms alternative resources for primary uses, including energy-intensive transportation and cooling. Ultimately, it also enhances the near-term energy framework by setting more ambitious green energy targets as a stepping-stone towards 100\% energy self-sufficiency by 2050.}

Achieving this objective will involve rapidly increasing the deployment of solar and wind energy, while at the same time addressing the related challenges of the financing requirements, environment impacts, and power grid integration. Developing energy on lands degraded by human activities rather than placing new infrastructure within natural habitats or areas of high production agriculture would reduce cumulative impacts and minimize land use conflicts. We estimated that converted lands have the potential capacity of 1789 GW across India, which is {$>$}10 times the 2022 goals.

If renewable energy is advanced with the singular aim of maximizing resource potential, approximately 6700--11,900 km2 of forest land and 24,100--55,700 km2 of agricultural land could be impacted. Subsidies and incentive programs aimed at promoting low-impact renewable energy deployment and establishing mitigation obligations that raise costs for projects that create land-impacts could improve the public support for renewable energy.},

In addition, we show that transmission has the potential to reduce levelised cost of electricity by approximately 10\%.}

While technological issues are more and more being overcome, the economic viability and thus possible adoption is still constrained, mainly by higher prices than for conventional vehicles. In our work we analyze possible market developments for electric vehicles with an application to Germany. We develop a drivetrain choice model with economical, technical and social constraints on the current vehicle registrations and inventory. It estimates the demand for electric vehicles until 2030 for private and commercially registered cars as well as light commercial vehicles. The results show a replacement potential of almost one third of the total German annual mileage for these vehicles. The result has a high granularity to allow for detailed emission calculation along different spatial areas as well as vehicle and engine types. Besides a baseline forecast, our method allows for calculating different scenarios regarding policy actions or the future development of important parameters such as energy prices. The results provide insights for policy measures as well as for transport and environmental modeling.}

Turkey is structured into seven geographical regions and all assumptions and data are collected and applied separately for the regions. The energy transition is simulated for two scenarios: a power sector scenario and power sector plus desalination and non-energetic industrial gas demand (integrated) scenario. Turkey has an enormous solar energy potential, which leads to an installed solar PV capacity of 287GW (71\% of total installed capacity) in the power scenario and 387GW (73\% of total installed capacity) in the integrated scenario in 2050. Solar PV and other installed RE systems are balanced by storage systems to increase the flexibility of the system. Levelised cost of electricity increased slightly in the power scenario, from a fossil fuel based system with 63{\texteuro}/MWhel in 2015 to a fully RE-based system with 65.4{\texteuro}/MWhel in 2050. The capacity mix in the power scenario entirely built for the assumptions of the year 2050 led to a cost of 51{\texteuro}/MWhel, which can also be expected in the periods beyond 2050. In the integrated scenario, however, the costs decreased from 60.3{\texteuro}/MWhel to 57.3{\texteuro}/MWhel, mainly due to the benefit of sector coupling. A 100\% RE system reduces energy import dependency and carbon emissions, while reducing the cost of energy supply.}

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Solar energy generation has become one of the most popular renewable energy sources for achieving global carbon neutrality. This transition to land-intensive energy generates inevitable land use conflicts with existing land cover, such as forest or agricultural land. South Korea is one of the countries currently experiencing conflicts in land use between ecosystems, food and energy. In addition, various land use problems occur, such as deforestation due to developments and an increase in idle agricultural land due to a decrease in the labor force. Thus, it is important to establish future land use policies that consider these issues. This study conducted a net present value (NPV) analysis for solving land use conflict by comparing monetary value according to different land use cases. Two land use scenarios were investigated: 1) land cover maintained (forest or agricultural land) and 2) land use change for solar energy generation. These two scenarios were compared in the target areas selected in this study to determine the criteria for the solar energy generation site. The economic values from Scenario 1were calculated primarily using ecosystem services assessment and market value, and those of Scenario 2 were calculated based on statistical data. The total suitable area for solar energy generation in Korea was 551,393 ha. As results, the NPV of forest ecosystem services was higher than that of solar energy generation in forest. In the case of idle agricultural land, agriculture caused a continuous deficit owing to carbon emissions, and accordingly, the carbon reduction effect through solar energy generation had a greater value than agricultural activities. This study attempted to resolve land use conflict by considering carbon neutrality through comparing economic values and introducing ecosystem services assessment and carbon credit price in the process of the analysis.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We reviewed 109 studies and harmonized the estimates of GHG emissions by aligning the assumptions, parameters, and system boundaries. During the initial screening we eliminated abstracts, short conference papers, presentations without supporting documentation, and unrelated analyses; 91 studies passed this initial screening. In the primary screening we applied rigorous criteria for completeness of reporting, validity of analysis methods, and modern relevance of the PV system studied. Additionally, we examined whether the product is a commercial one, whether the production line still exists, and whether the study's core data are original or secondary. These screenings produced five studies as the best representations of the carbon footprint of modern thin-film PV technologies. These were harmonized through alignment of efficiency, irradiation, performance ratio, balance of system, and lifetime. The resulting estimates for carbon footprints are 20, 14, and 26 grams carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour (g CO2-eq/kWh), respectively, for a-Si, CdTe, and CIGS, for ground-mount application under southwestern United States (US-SW) irradiation of 2,400 kilowatt-hours per square meter per year (kWh/m2/yr), a performance ratio of 0.8, and a lifetime of 30 years. Harmonization for the rooftop PV systems with a performance ratio of 0.75 and the same irradiation resulted in carbon footprint estimates of 21, 14, and 27 g CO2-eq/kWh, respectively, for the three technologies. This screening and harmonization rectifies previous incomplete or outdated assessments and clarifies variations in carbon footprints across studies and amongst thin-film technologies.},

Implementing respective constraints in energy models is a surprisingly delicate issue. They may cause a modeling artifact of excessive electricity storage use. We introduce this phenomenon as ``unintended storage cycling'', which can be detected in case of simultaneous storage charging and discharging. In this paper, we provide an analytical representation of different approaches for implementing minimum renewable share constraints in energy models, and show how these may lead to unintended storage cycling. Using a parsimonious optimization model, we quantify related distortions of optimal dispatch and investment decisions as well as market prices, and identify important drivers of the phenomenon. Finally, we provide recommendations on how to avoid the distorting effects of unintended storage cycling in energy modeling.},

  abstract = {Comprehensive numerical models are pivotal to analyze the decarbonization of electricity systems. However, increasing system complexity and limited computational resources impose restrictions to model-based analyses. One way to reduce computational burden is to use a minimum, yet representative, set of system states for model simulation. These states characterize fluctuating renewable generation and variable demand for electricity prevailing at a certain point in time. A review of possible time series aggregation techniques identifies cluster algorithms as most adequate, with k-Means and the Ward algorithm predominating. However, throughout the surveyed literature, the line of reasoning for the selection of these algorithms remains unclear. To support the electricity system modeling community in selecting an algorithm, this paper devises a systematic multi-stage evaluation approach to compare a large variety of cluster analysis configurations, differing in algorithm, cluster representation, and number of clusters. Results show that electricity demand and renewable energy generation time series can be compressed to below one percent while sustaining global characteristics of the original data. Two potent cluster configurations are identified, confirming k-Means and WARD as being prevalent. Beyond electricity market data, the methodology can be applied to various types of fundamental time-dependent input data.},

Variables including electricity, as well as primary fuels, technologies, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with power generation can be traced through the network, providing energy source composition statistics for power consumers at a given location. Results show opportunities for more precise measurement by consumers of emissions occurring on their behalf at power plants. Specifically, we show a larger range of possible factors (?0 to 1.3 kgCO2/kWh) as compared to the range provided by the EPA?s eGRID analysis (?0.4 to 1 kgCO2/kWh). We also show that 66?73\% of the variance in PCA-level estimated emissions savings is the result of PCA-to-PCA differences that are not captured by the larger eGRID subregions. The increased precision could bolster development of effective greenhouse gas reporting and mitigation policies. This study also highlights the need for improvements in the consistency and spatiotemporal resolution of PCA-level generation and exchange data reporting.}

  abstract = {There is an increasing demand for renewable electricity sources, due to the global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. Despite the promising effects, only a limited amount of electricity is currently produced globally from solar power. In order to help countries realize the importance of tapping into solar energy, it is crucial to reveal the potential amount of electricity that could be thus produced.For this reason, open data were used to produce an interactive web map of the global solar energy potential. For the calculation of the potential, the top-down approach, generally used in the literature, was modified by introducing a better way of calculating rooftop areas, and accounting for temperature, which highly reduces PV panels' efficiency. Mean annual temperature data were introduced to improve its accuracy, and an approach to estimate rooftop and fa{\c c}ade areas as a function of GDP was developed. The current global solar potential technically available was estimated at about 613 PWh/y. Furthermore, the cost of photovoltaic generation was computed and extremely low values, 0.03 - 0.2 \$/kWh, were derived.},

  abstract = {Integration of renewable energy sources in microgrids can be achieved via demand response programs, which change the electric usage in response to changes in the availability and price of electricity over time. This paper presents a novel control algorithm for joint demand response management and thermal comfort optimization in microgrids equipped with renewable energy sources and energy storage units. The proposed work aims at covering two main gaps in current state-of-the-art demand response programs. The first gap is integrating the objective of matching energy generation and consumption with the occupant behavior and with the objective of guaranteeing thermal comfort of the occupants. The second gap is developing a scalable and robust demand response program. Large-scale nature of the optimization problem and robustness are achieved via a two-level supervisory closed-loop feedback strategy: at the lower level, each building of the microgrid employs a local closed-loop feedback controller that processes only local measurements; at the upper level, a centralized unit supervises and updates the local controllers with the aim of minimizing the aggregate energy cost and thermal discomfort of the microgrid. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in a microgrid composed of three buildings, a photovoltaic array, a wind turbine, and an energy storage unit. Comparisons with alternative demand response strategies reveal that the proposed strategy efficiently integrates the renewable sources; energy costs are reduced and at the same time thermal comfort of the occupants is guaranteed. Furthermore, robustness is proved via consistent improvements achieved under heterogeneous conditions (different occupancy schedules and different weather conditions).}

This paper investigates the impact of the storage technology Power-to-Gas (PtG) in the implementation of the Energiewende. A detailed cost optimisation model based on data from an existing system in an actual German region describes the optimal composition and application of energy supply technologies. The electricity demand of the region can be covered with 100\% renewable energy (RE) at a levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of 11ct/kWhel. A 100\% RE supply is possible with or without PtG. However, long-term energy storage system such as PtG reduce the LCOE of the energy system significantly. We conclude that the capital expenditures (CAPEX) of PtG must at least reach values below 2500{\texteuro}/kWel to compete with short-term solutions such as Li-ion batteries. Beside PtG this investigation identifies several system components with extensive impact on LCOE and demand of long-term energy storage, such as Power to Heat (PtH), wind turbine technology and hydropower. The combination of such influences increases the impact of each of them on the LCOE. Several energy system components can positively influence the implementation of the Energiewende, PtG is one of them.}

We found that the PtG capital expenditures (CAPEX) do not significantly affect the optimal system in terms of the installed capacity of PtG. Due to the high storage capacity of the existing gas grid, the use of PtG results in lower LCOE than the use of batteries. Alteration of system components towards greaterfluctuating energy production increases the need forlong-term energy storage, especially PtG, and results inhigher total costs. In summary, this investigation demonstrates the significance of Power-to-Gas.}

The model can use wind, solar, hydro, biomass, geothermal as renewable energy sources and fossil fuel blocks and grid connection with mainland as back up. The load in the model can be represented by hourly and deferrable electricity loads of the power system, by hourly heat load, by hydrogen load for transport and by water load depending on water consumption. The H2RES model also has ability to integrate different storages into island energy system in order to increase the penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources or to achieve a 100\% renewable island. Energy storages could vary from hydrogen loop (fuel cell, electrolyser and hydrogen storage) to reversible hydro or batteries for smaller energy systems. The H2RES model was tested on the power system of the Island of Porto Santo -- Madeira, the islands of Corvo, Graciosa, and Terrciera -- Azores, Sal Island -- Cape Verde, Portugal, the Island of Mljet, Croatia and on the energy system of the Malta.

  abstract = {Portugal is a country with an energy system highly dependent on oil and gas imports. Imports of oil and gas accounted for 85\% of the country's requirements in 2005 and 86\% in 2006. Meanwhile, the share of renewable energy sources (RES) in the total primary energy consumption was only 14\% in 2006. When focusing only on electricity production, the situation is somewhat better. The share of RES in gross electricity production varies between 20\% and 35\% and is dependent on the hydropower production in wet and dry years. This paper presents, on a national scale, Portugal's energy system planning and technical solutions for achieving 100\% RES electricity production. Planning was based on hourly energy balance and use of H2RES software. The H2RES model provides the ability to integrate various types of storages into energy systems in order to increase penetration of the intermittent renewable energy sources or to achieve a 100\% renewable island, region or country. The paper also represents a stepping-stone for studies offering wider possibilities in matching and satisfying electricity supply in Portugal with potential renewable energy sources. Special attention has been given to intermittent sources such as wind, solar and ocean waves that can be coupled to appropriate energy storage systems charged with surplus amounts of produced electricity. The storage systems also decrease installed power requirements for generating units. Consequently, these storages will assist in avoiding unnecessary rejection of renewable potential and reaching a sufficient security of energy supply.}

Energy systems of this society will be based on four pillars: Renewable Energy, Buildings as Positive Power Plants, Energy Storage and Smart grids in combination with Plug-in Vehicles. All these pillars must be supported by the use of smart energy storage. The results of previous research has shown that in order to increase security, efficiency and viability, there is need for energy storage, in primary or secondary form, in order to transfer energy surplus from period of excess to the period when there is a lack. The problem of today's storage systems is that they increase the cost of already expensive, distributed and renewable energy sources. That makes the large scale use of storage systems even less economically viable in market circumstances, despite economics of scale. The paper shows results of an energy planning methodology applied to several cases where use of smart energy storage system helps integration of energy flows, transformations and energy demand at the location of the energy end-use or close to it. Main results presented in this paper focus on planning a 100\% independent energy system of Croatia. They also show the role of energy storage in a self-sustainable energy system with excess electricity production from renewable energy sources. The technical and financial analyses have been carried out for periods of one year taking into consideration demands and renewable energy production during all hours.}

We applied this model to the case of France and built contrasted scenarios, from 0\% to 100\% renewable energy penetration by 2050. We also tested different assumptions on Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) production, imports, demand flexibility and biomass potential. We show that high renewable energy penetration would need significant investments in new capacities, new flexibility options along with imports and demand-response, and that it is likely to deteriorate power system reliability if no technologies dedicated to this issue are installed.}

It examines the motivations they are aiming at in their online communications to convince potential buyers and how they describe living with a PV system. Economic benefits of PV systems are mentioned most frequently. Environmental arguments are also put forward, mainly to signal that buyers are making a valuable contribution to protecting the climate if they invest in PV. Only small parts of the online communication directly relate to energy consumption behaviour in the usage phase. Following this analysis, we discuss how the way PV systems are framed by SI could influence the expectations of households regarding electricity use. This is important with regard to climate mitigation strategies that assume a reduced energy demand in addition to increasing renewable energy sources. Therefore, our discussion focuses on possible rebound effects i.e. an increased electricity consumption by owners of PV systems. We hypothesise that the arguments provided by SI could instigate moral licensing, i.e. support the perception that with a PV system, households have fulfilled their environmental duties and therefore are free to use more electricity. Furthermore, the strong emphasis on economic arguments could weaken other motivations. This leads to the conclusions that (i) further research is needed concerning the influence of sales communications on actual consumption as well as (ii) the recommendation that communication strategies around PV systems should address the usage phase more carefully.}

The main target is to reduce global CO2 emissions to 10Gt per year in 2050, thus limiting global average temperature increase to 2{$^\circ$}C and preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. A review of sector and region specific energy efficiency measures resulted in the specification of a global energy demand scenario incorporating strong energy efficiency measures. The corresponding energy supply scenario has been developed in an iterative process in close cooperation with stakeholders and regional counterparts from academia, NGOs and the renewable energy industry. The Energy [R]evolution scenario shows that renewable energy can provide more than half of the world's energy needs by 2050. Developing countries can virtually stabilise their CO2 emissions, whilst at the same time increasing energy consumption through economic growth. OECD countries will be able to reduce their emissions by up to 80\%.}

We locate and verify 68,661 facilities, an increase of 432 per cent (in number of facilities) on previously available asset-level data. With the help of a hand-labelled test set, we estimate global installed generating capacity to be 423\,gigawatts (-75/+77\,gigawatts)~at the end of 2018. Enrichment of our dataset with estimates of facility installation date, historic land-cover classification and proximity to vulnerable areas allows us to show that most of the PV solar energy facilities are sited on cropland, followed by aridlands and grassland.

Reducing temporal complexity is often achieved by using time-series aggregating and modelling representative periods instead of a complete time series. But the impacts of such approaches are still poorly understood, especially for very low emissions systems with high shares of variable renewable energies. In this paper, the impacts of using time-series aggregation methods on optimal system design are investigated. It is found that the negative impact of time-series aggregation increases for lower emissions. It is also identified that modelling wind time-series data with representative days introduces this negative impact primarily and that representing wind time-series data with representative days decreases the reliability of supply defined as unserved load (0.05\%e18.0\%), introduces a bias in installed capacity ({\`A}31.15\% to {\th}12.2\%), and underestimates total system cost (2.5\% e44.9\%). These effects are largest in cases with the strongest emission constraints. When designing low emissions systems with a high share of variable renewable energies, it is recommended not to use timeseries aggregation to create representative days for wind power output. This paper contributes an Open Source analysis framework containing time-series aggregation and capacity expansion that should be applied when testing future time-series aggregation methods to reduce the identified negative impacts. {\copyright} 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {As power systems shift towards increasing wind and solar electricity generation, inter-annual variability (IAV) of wind and solar resource and generation will pose increasing challenges to power system planning and operations. To help gauge these challenges to the power system, we quantify IAV of wind and solar resource and electricity generation across the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) power system, then assess the IAV of wind and solar electricity generation during peak-load hours (i.e. IAV of wind and solar capacity values) for the current ERCOT wind and solar generator fleet. To do so, we leverage the long timespan of four reanalysis datasets with the high resolution of grid integration datasets. We find the IAV (quantified as the coefficient of variation) of wind generation ranges from 2.3\%--11\% across ERCOT, while the IAV of solar generation ranges from 1.7\%--5\% across ERCOT. We also find significant seasonal and regional variability in the IAV of wind and solar generation, highlighting the importance of considering multiple temporal and spatial scales when planning and operating the power system. In addition, the IAV of the current wind and solar fleets' capacity values (defined as generation during peak-load hours) are larger than the IAV of the same fleets' capacity factors. IAV of annual generation and capacity values of wind and solar could impact operations and planning in several ways, e.g. through annual emissions, meeting emission reduction targets, and investment needs to maintain capacity adequacy.},

In response, this research develops a scalable decision-support tool for identifying suitable areas for solar energy generation in the state. This paper provides guidance for state agency-driven solar development by evaluating the suitability of potential generation areas in terms of environmental impact, socioeconomic costs, and energy productivity, and providing a forum for critical decision-making. More specifically, geospatial technologies are combined with a suitability analysis to reveal the potential for solar energy generation on public lands. This study demonstrates the usefulness of the resulting information for supporting both regional and local decision-making as a Planning Support System (PSS). Our analysis suggests that the large-scale analysis using fine resolution data is useful for comparison and site-specific decision making - with site verification protocols in terms of physical implementation. We find that planning decisions for solar development should use a fine-grained suitability approach at a large scale and a feasibility analysis at a specific scale. We present our findings in statewide application along with a scalable PSS tool to optimize and support solar decision-making process and democratize the information for engaging a broader audience.}

Arguably, the most significant effect of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico was the electric power outage that initially affected the entire island and lasted more than ten months. Although the damage to the conventional electric power generation infrastructure was relatively minor, both the transmission and distribution portions of the grid suffered much worse damage than that observed during other hurricanes that affected the U.S. in the past decade. This extensive damage added to logistical limitations and the island orography were important factors that contributed to an extremely slow restoration process leading to a very low resilience for the island's power grid. This paper describes all these aspects in detail and supports the explanation of the hurricane effects with photographic evidence collected during a damage assessment conducted in the early December 2017 when about half of the electricity customers were still without service. This paper concludes by exploring some lessons from these observations including potential options to increase resilience, such as the use of microgrids.}

The main cause of outage was lack of power due to fuel supply disruptions, flooding and security issues. This work also describes the means used to restore telecommunications services and proposes ways to improve logistics, such as coordinating portable generator set deployment among different network operators and reducing genset fuel consumption by installing permanent photovoltaic systems at sites where long electric outages are likely. One long term solution is to use of distributed generation. It also discusses the consequences on telecom power technology and practices since the storm.}

Studies have shown that the DTR system can provide ratings that are higher than the traditional static thermal rating (STR) 80\% to 90\% of the time; 50\% of the time, DTR is 15\% to 30\% higher than STR. Hence, the benefits and applications of the DTR system have been widely investigated and reported in various review papers. However, available reviews of the DTR system focused on transmission lines and networks only, ignoring the thermal limits of the transformer and distribution cable, which could form a thermal bottleneck. Moreover, these review articles cover only a few research themes, and many important research topics are left undiscussed. Therefore, these reviews cannot provide sufficiently diverse research on the DTR system. These drawbacks are addressed in this review article, which covers 176 notable research articles related to the DTR system obtained from three major databases, namely, IEEE, Elsevier, and Wiley. The collected articles are categorized based on their focus (e.g., distribution networks, transmission networks, and transformers) and then further classified into small groups on the basis of their research themes. Such an approach provides prospective researchers of the DTR system a one-stop summary of all previous studies.},

This need for reliability and resource adequacy is the foundation of the Integrated Resources Plan (IRP) required by many states. A component of the plan includes the study of a system's ability to transfer power over the transmission network through import and/or export. Utilities commonly study this by manually simulating large sets of contingencies---an exhaustive and multi-step process. Dominion Energy has developed an automation toolset that leverages pyPowerGEM and Python to create simulations and tune generation dispatch, while maintaining N-1 security. Results for various use cases showed that the transfer capability automation tool, the first component of the toolset, dramatically reduced the time to calculate transfer capability---by up to 90\%. Moreover, the transfer capability enhancement tool, the second component of the toolset, improved the transfer capability through generation redispatching, which provided engineers with a better understanding of the transmission network constraints and how they can affect access to needed electricity. The tool's graphical user interface (GUI) allows access to a large range of users interested in understanding both import and export transfer capability limits. While this automation tool was built and tested for Dominion Energy, the general outline of the tool provided in this paper can be adopted by other utilities and adapted to their systems.},

We present a conceptual model to estimate the economics of accessing high quality wind resources in remote areas to comply with renewable energy policy targets, and apply the model to the Midwestern grid (MISO) as a case study. We assess the goal of providing 40TWh of new wind generation while minimizing costs, and include temporal aspects of wind power (variability costs and correlation to market prices) as well as total wind power produced from different farms. We find that building wind farms in North/South Dakota (windiest states) compared to Illinois (less windy, but close to load) would only be economical if the incremental transmission costs to access them were below \$360/kW of wind capacity (break-even value). Historically, the incremental transmission costs for wind development in North/South Dakota compared to in Illinois are about twice this value. However, the break-even incremental transmission cost for wind farms in Minnesota/Iowa (also windy states) is \$250/kW, which is consistent with historical costs. We conclude that wind development in Minnesota/Iowa is likely more economical to meet MISO renewable targets compared to North/South Dakota or Illinois.},

New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength {\textohm} becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system {$\omega$}. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large {\textohm}/{$\omega$}c = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling {\textohm} {$\propto$} {\textsurd}n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 {\texttimes} 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few ({$<$};100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled ({\textohm}/{$\omega$}- {\textbar}{\textbar}}

Although building emissions today are 25\% below their 2005 peak, far deeper reductions are needed to reach the US 2050 net-zero emissions goal. However, plausible decarbonization pathways that consider both buildings and their interactions with the power grid remain poorly understood. Here, we couple detailed modeling of building energy use and the grid to quantify building decarbonization potential and associated grid impacts. We find up to a 91\% reduction in building CO2 emissions from 2005 levels by 2050 using a portfolio of building efficiency, demand flexibility, and electrification measures alongside rapid grid decarbonization. Building efficiency and flexibility could generate up to \$107 billion in annual power system cost savings by 2050, offsetting over a third of the incremental cost of full grid decarbonization. Our results underscore multiple benefits of demand-side solutions for deep decarbonization of US buildings.}

To assess the potential scale and cost of CO2 sequestration from BECCS in the US, this analysis models carbon sequestration net of supply chain emissions and costs of biomass production, delivery, power generation, and CO2 capture and sequestration in saline formations. The analysis includes two biomass supply scenarios (near-term and long-term), two biomass logistics scenarios (conventional and pelletized), and two generation technologies (pulverized combustion and integrated gasification combined cycle). Results show marginal cost per tonne CO2 (accounting for costs of electricity and CO2 emissions of reference power generation scenarios) as a function of CO2 sequestered (simulating capture of up to 90\% of total CO2 sequestration potential) and associated spatial distribution of resources and generation locations for the array of scenario options. Under a near-term scenario using up to 206 million tonnes per year of biomass, up to 181 million tonnes CO2 can be sequestered annually at scenario-average costs ranging from \$62 to \$137 per tonne CO2; under a long-term scenario using up to 740 million tonnes per year of biomass, up to 737 million tonnes CO2 can be sequestered annually at scenario-average costs ranging from \$42 to \$92 per tonne CO2. These estimates of CO2 sequestration potential may be reduced if future competing demand reduces resource availability or may be increased if displaced emissions from conventional power sources are included. Results suggest there are large-scale opportunities to implement BECCS at moderate cost in the US, particularly in the Midwest, Plains States, and Texas.},

In this paper we use environmentally-extended input--output tables to: (a) quantify the long-term drivers that have led to diversified energy footprint profiles of 186 countries around the world from 1990 to 2010; (b) identify which countries and sectors recorded an increase or decrease in energy footprints during this time period; (c) highlight the effect of international outsourcing of energy-intensive production processes by decomposing the structural and spatial change in energy footprints; and (d) discuss the implications for national economic policy for the identified drivers. To this end, we use a detailed Multi-Regional Input--Output database and three prevalent structural decomposition analysis methods. To reduce biases in the results due to time lapse and currency variations, we convert input--output tables to common US\$ and 1990-constant prices. This study provides a broad overview of the magnitude and distribution of the drivers for energy footprints across countries. The results of this study demonstrate that for almost all countries affluence and population growth are driving energy footprints worldwide, which is in part counteracted by the retarding effect of industrial energy intensity. In particular, this study demonstrates that with increasing per-capita GDP, the total energy footprint of a country is increasingly concentrated on imports or consumption.}

(2016) evaluate societal benefits and other impacts for this same scenario. Under reference or central conditions, the analysis finds cumulative wind capacity of 404 gigawatts (GW) would be required to reach this level and drive 2050 incremental electricity rate and cumulative electric sector savings of 2\% and 3\% respectively, relative to a scenario with no new wind capacity additions. Greater savings are estimated under higher fossil fuel costs or with greater advancements in wind technologies. Conversely, incremental costs are found when fossil fuel costs are lower than central assumptions or wind technology improvements are more-limited. Through 2030, the primary generation sources displaced by new wind capacity include natural gas and coal-fired generation. By 2050, wind could displace other renewables. Incremental new transmission infrastructure totaling 29 million megawatt-miles is estimated to be needed by 2050. In conjunction with related societal benefits, this work demonstrates that 35\% wind energy by 2050 is plausible, could support enduring benefits, and could result in long-term consumer savings, if nearer-term (pre-2030) cost barriers are overcome; at the same time, these opportunities are not anticipated to be realized in their full form under ``business-as-usual'' conditions.}

  abstract = {An interactive web tool was created to simulate 100\% renewable electricity supply scenarios for the South-West Interconnected System (SWIS) in the south-west of Western Australia. The SWIS is isolated from other grids and currently has no available hydropower. Hence it makes a good case study of how supply and demand might be balanced on an hour-by-hour basis and grid stability maintained without the benefit of energy import/export or pumped hydroelectric storage. The tool included regional models for wind and solar power, so that hypothetical power stations were not confined to sites with existing wind farms or solar power stations, or sites with measurements of wind speed and solar radiation. A generic model for solar thermal storage and simple models for energy efficiency, distributed battery storage and power to gas storage were also developed. Due to the urgency of climate change mitigation a rapid construction schedule of completion by 2030, rather than the more common target of 2050, was set. A scenario with high wind generation, and scenarios with varying levels of solar power, wind power, distributed battery storage, energy efficiency improvements and power to gas systems were considered. The battery storage system and PV arrays were configured to provide synthetic inertia to maintain grid stability (with a small loss in capacity for each), and existing synchronous generators were kept spinning with no fuel input, adding a small increase to the electrical load demand. The level of synthetic inertia provided by battery storage was estimated for each scenario. The results indicated that a balanced mix of solar PV, solar thermal, efficiency, and storage were the most feasible to be built on a rapid time scale. The required capacity and build rate of the generation and storage systems would be reduced if energy efficiency improvements were implemented on a more rapid schedule compared to the current global improvement rate. The scenario with very high levels of wind power ({$\sim$}80\% generation) were found to be capable of meeting SWIS reliability criteria if very large amounts of distributed storage or some high capacity seasonal reserve generation system such as power to gas were present. High levels of battery storage capacity and efficiency improvement could be as effective as a power to gas system. It was confirmed that all scenarios provided the same or greater levels of inertia than presently provided by conventional generators. This tool showed that it is possible to examine renewable energy scenarios for regional electricity networks without high computing power.}

  abstract = {Optimal transmission line rating use is guaranteed with dynamic line rating (DLR). It is a smart grid technology that foresees variations in meteorological conditions affecting line rating and deploys algorithms to effect changes to the line rating due to these conditions. Electric power system operators use forecasted DLR for system planning, operation, and delivery. This study reviewed DLR forecasting techniques, classified them, implemented them, and compared their outputs at different lead times. It deployed quantile regression (QR), ensemble means forecasting, recurrent neural network (RNN), and convolution neural network (CNN). Ensemble forecasting technique deployed in this study involves a Monte-Carlo simulation that produces random, equally viable pre\- dicting solutions. Alternatively, a neural network layer's initial outcome is fed back into it to predict the output in RNN, while CNN learns to predict features that vary in time and space with marginal discrepancies. This study used quantile regression, ensemble forecasting, RNN and CNN to forecast DLR at 12hrs, 24hrs and 48hrs. The tested forecasting approaches prove efficient, but ensemble forecasting seems less error-prone, more secure and conservative among all methods. On average, 75th percentile quantile regression and ensemble forecasting demonstrate better reliability and avail us the better choice of ampacity among the forecasting techniques.},

  abstract = {With an increasing expected energy demand and current dominance of coal electrification, India plays a major role in global carbon policies and the future low-carbon transformation. This paper explores three energy pathways for India until 2050 by applying the linear, cost-minimizing, global energy system model (GENeSYS-MOD). The benchmark scenario \&ldquo;limited emissions only\&rdquo; (LEO) is based on ambitious targets set out by the Paris Agreement. A more conservative \&ldquo;business as usual\&rdquo; (BAU) scenario is sketched out along the lines of the New Policies scenario from the International Energy Agency (IEA). On the more ambitious side, we explore the potential implications of supplying the Indian economy entirely with renewable energies with the \&ldquo;100\% renewable energy sources\&rdquo; (100\% RES) scenario. Overall, our results suggest that a transformation process towards a low-carbon energy system in the power, heat, and transportation sectors until 2050 is technically feasible. Solar power is likely to establish itself as the key energy source by 2050 in all scenarios, given the model\&rsquo;s underlying emission limits and technical parameters. The paper concludes with an analysis of potential social, economic and political barriers to be overcome for the needed Indian low-carbon transformation.},

The results suggest typical system sizes range from 5 kWh/2.6 kW for low electricity intensity homes to 22 kWh/5.2 kW for electricity intense homes with electric space heating. Based on the resulting storage system cycling profile and data provided by other researchers, the battery life is estimated to be in the range of 10--20 years for this application.}

Using data collected from 1603 counties in 23 states, I find local policymakers are more likely to enact wind ordinances when they have more time to interact with wind developers and when neighboring counties have adopted wind ordinances or approved the construction of wind farms. I also observe that counties tend to adopt more stringent rules when more wind farms have been built in neighboring counties. This evidence suggests that efforts to scale up renewable energy generation may encounter increasing resistance from local governments.},

Little is known about how such development may impact animal movement. Here, we use five spatially explicit projections of solar energy development through 2050 to assess the extent to which ground-mounted photovoltaic solar energy expansion in the continental United States may impact land-cover and alter areas important for animal movement. Our results suggest that there could be a substantial overlap between solar energy development and land important for animal movement: across projections, 7--17\% of total development is expected to occur on land with high value for movement between large protected areas, while 27--33\% of total development is expected to occur on land with high value for climate-change-induced migration. We also found substantial variation in the potential overlap of development and land important for movement at the state level. Solar energy development, and the policies that shape it, may align goals for biodiversity and climate change by incorporating the preservation of animal movement as a consideration in the planning process.}

  abstract = {The co-planning problem of transmission and energy storage system (ESS) requires a large amount of historical and forecasted input data to account for the volatility of renewable energy and loads. However, the large input data usually make the planning problem difficult to solve, so time series aggregation is often used to reduce the computational complexity. Nevertheless, it is difficult to guarantee the reliability of operation on the whole input data. Therefore, this paper proposes an iterative method to select extreme scenarios, and designs two indicators to select extreme scenarios, considering the system power balance and peak shaving capacity situation. Based on these two indicators, the periods of maximum load shedding and the periods of maximum renewable energy curtailment will be selected as extreme scenarios in the results of the operational optimization problem. We iteratively add extreme scenarios to the set of scenarios of the planning problem until the reliability of system operation can be adequately met. At the same time, in order to ensure the effectiveness of extreme scenarios, the operation statuses of thermal units in those periods are also taken into account. Our method is tested on an IEEE RTS-24 system with some modification. The results show that our method can guarantee the reliability of the whole system and is superior to the method that simply selects extreme scenarios. Meanwhile, we also perform a sensitivity analysis of the price of energy storage.},

  abstract = {In the near future, wind and solar generation are projected to play an increasingly important role in Europe's energy sector. With such fast-growing renewable energy development, the presence of simultaneous calm wind and overcast conditions could cause significant shortfalls in production with potentially serious consequences for system operators. Such events are sometimes dubbed ``Dunkelflaute'' events and have occurred several times in recent history. The capabilities of contemporary mesoscale models to reliably simulate and/or forecast a Dunkelflaute event are not known in the literature. In this paper, a Dunkelflaute event near the coast of Belgium is simulated utilizing the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Comprehensive validation using measured power production data and diverse sets of meteorological data (e.g., floating lidars, radiosondes, and weather stations) indicates the potential of WRF to reproduce and forecast the boundary layer evolution during the event. Extensive sensitivity experiments with respect to grid-size, wind farm parameterization, and forcing datasets provide further insights on the reliability of the WRF model in capturing the Dunkelflaute event.},

Co-locating wind and PV can lead to synergies in power production, infrastructure, and land usage, which may lower the overall plant cost compared to single technology systems. This review paper summarizes the existing research on power output modeling related to utility-scale HPPs and identifies knowledge-gaps. The main literature shows that there is a need for improved modeling methodologies accounting for the variability of the combined power production. There is potential for immediate improvement by combining state-of-the-art models that have been developed in separate fields and harmonizing the vocabulary across the different research fields. The study also shows that the total number of peer reviewed studies on utility-scale HPPs is limited and further research, in particular comparative studies, is needed to give a comprehensive view of the benefits and challenges of combining technologies. Other areas such as physical design, control strategies, market participation, and quantification of the possible synergies for physical implementation of HPPs also need to be studied further.}

Building partitions are obtained by a multi-energy unified clustering model based on a K-means algorithm and performed for the electrical, heating, cooling, and gas loads of various buildings. The availability of all types of resources is evaluated by clustering the local resource data. According to the unified analysis of characteristics such as the thermoelectric ratio of loads and availability of resources, suitable energy supply equipment are selected to form an alternative structure set. Capacity configuration optimization models are established based on energy, economy, and environmental evaluation indicators considering the offdesign performance of the equipment. The GA is used to optimize the configuration of each alternative structure for every partition. The system evaluation indicators are sorted by the linear weighting method to obtain an optimal system configuration suitable for each building partition. A case study is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The energy supply effect of the system designed for each partition is significantly improved compared with that of a separated production system. The proposed method has engineering significance for guiding the construction of regional IESs.},

Due to the increasing penetration of renewables, CEP has to capture the hourly variations of renewable generator outputs and load demand. Since CEP problems typically involve planning horizons of several years, solving the fullspace models where the operating decisions corresponding to all the days is intractable. Therefore, some ``representative days'' are selected as a surrogate to the fullspace model. We present an input-based and a cost-based approach in combination with the {$k$}-means and the {$k$}-medoids clustering algorithms for representative day selection. The mathematical properties of the proposed algorithms are analyzed, including an approach to calculate the ``optimality gap'' of the investment decisions obtained from the representative day model to the fullspace model, and the relationship between the clustering error and the optimality gap. To capture the extreme operating conditions, two novel approaches, i.e., a ``load shedding cost'' approach and a ``highest cost'' approach, are proposed to identify the ``extreme days''. We conclude with a case study based on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region, which compares the different approaches and the effects of adding the extreme days.},

However, RES contribution to supply peak demand with much higher shares of renewable energy, and even close to 100\%, has been less studied, and the actual feasibility of such a RES-dominated system in terms of preserving a certain level of system reliability is as yet unclear. In this work, a Monte Carlo simulation model is adopted to quantify the system adequacy level. The availability curves of conventional generation units are simulated based on the state-duration sampling method combined with a three-state transition model of generation units. Parametric studies are conducted to explore the characteristics of system adequacy levels under different RES penetration levels as well as different wind and solar installed capacity mixes. At the same time, the benefits of coordinating large-scale energy storage, modelled as pumped-hydro storage plant, with RES are assessed and demonstrated. The results from several case studies on a reduced test version of the Australian eastern interconnected power system highlight how the proposed characterization method can inform strategic, reliability-aware planning of future RES-dominated power systems.}

  abstract = {Capacity credit (CC) can be defined as the capacity of conventional generators that can be replaced by renewable energy sources (RES) and/or other resources such as energy storage without reducing system reliability. Conventional approaches for calculating CC typically treat the power system as a single area without considering transfer constraints and reliability of interconnectors. However, in multi-area power systems locational aspects are key to assess tradeoffs and synergies arising from transmission, storage and RES in providing adequacy of supply. In this work, we propose a new methodology to quantify the CC of RES and storage in a multi-area power system. Due to the large computational burden brought about by composite system adequacy evaluation, a new accelerated sequential Monte Carlo simulation strategy and a new adaptive sampling approach are specifically developed to achieve computation efficiency. The proposed methodology is tested by demonstrating the impact of interconnectors' transfer constraints and availability on RES-storage CC in the case of the Australian National Energy Market (NEM) multi-area power system, with applications to wind, solar, and pumped hydro storage plants. The results from several realistic NEM case studies highlight how the proposed model can inform strategic, reliability-aware integrated system planning of large-scale interconnected low-carbon power systems.}

  abstract = {Rapid economic growth in China has lead to an increasing energy demand in the country. In combination with China's emission control and clean air initiatives, it has resulted in large-scale expansion of the leading renewable energy technologies, wind and solar power. Their intermittent nature and uneven geographic distribution, however, raises the question of how to best exploit them in a future sustainable electricity system, where their combined production may very well exceed that of all other technologies. It is well known that interconnecting distant regions provides more favorable production patterns from wind and solar. On the other hand, long-distance connections challenge traditional local energy autonomy. In this paper, the advantage of interconnecting the contiguous provinces of China is quantified. To this end, two different methodologies are introduced. The first aims at gradually increasing heterogeneity, that is non-local wind and solar power production, to minimize production costs without regard to the match between production and demand. The second method optimizes the trade-off between low cost production and high utility value of the energy. In both cases, the study of a 100\% renewable Chinese electricity network is based on 8 years of high-resolution hourly time series of wind and solar power generation and electricity demand for each of the provinces. From the study we conclude that compared to a baseline design of homogeneously distributed renewable capacities, a heterogeneous network not only lowers capital investments but also reduces backup dispatches from thermal units. Installing more capacity in provinces like Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, Hainan and north-western regions, heterogeneous layouts may lower the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by up to 27\%, and reduce backup needs by up to 64\%.}

  abstract = {Power system capacity-expansion models are typically intractable if every operating period is represented. This issue is normally overcome by using a subset of representative operating periods. For instance, representative operating hours can be selected by discretizing the load-duration curve, which captures the effect of load levels on system-operation costs. This approach is inappropriate if system-operating costs depend on parameters other than load (e.g., renewable-resource availability) or if there are important intertemporal operating constraints (e.g., generator-ramping limits). This paper proposes the use of representative operating days, which are selected using clustering, to surmount these issues. We propose two hierarchical clustering techniques, which are designed to capture the important statistical features of the parameters (e.g., load and renewable-resource availability), in selecting representative days. This includes temporal autocorrelations and correlations between different locations. A case study, which is based on the Texan power system, is used to demonstrate the techniques. We show that our proposed clustering techniques result in investment decisions that closely match those made using the full unclustered dataset.}

It also models the economic willingness of investors to build the required reactors as a profit-maximizing decision. The analysis computes the optimum path of investment and disinvestment in one or more uranium-based fuel cycles as dynamic profit maximization under physical constraints, and the resulting economic decisions are compared with physical decarbonization goals. Investor decisions prove to be insensitive to the electricity price (and hence to higher carbon tax) above a low threshold. Above that price threshold, their decisions on reactor investment are dominated by the total supply of uranium and the speed at which reactors can be built. In order to pay for the very large generating capacity needed, profit-maximizing investors seem to need of the order of 36 M tons of uranium reserves to use (some seven times the world's presently identified reserves). Even given this supply, they will limit their maximum investment in capacity if the build rate of reactors is too slow. If the world does choose to decarbonize, it will be necessary to manage uranium prospecting, and reactor building, purchase and operation as an interdependent system, and there will be a steep task of uranium exploration over the next decade or two.},

In 2009, China has become both the largest energy consumer and CO2 emitting country in the world. In this case, the inappropriate energy consumption structure should be changed. As an alternative, a suitable infrastructure for the implementation of renewable energy may serve as a long-term sustainable solution. The perspective of a 100\% renewable energy system has been analyzed and discussed in some countries previously. In this process, assessment of domestic renewable energy sources is the first step. Then appropriate methodologies are needed to perform energy system analyses involving the integration of more sustainable strategies. Denmark may serve as an example of how sustainable strategies can be implemented. The Danish system has demonstrated the possibility of converting into a 100\% renewable energy system. This paper discusses the perspective of renewable energy in China firstly, and then analyses whether it is suitable to adopt similar methodologies applied in other countries as China approaches a renewable energy system. The conclusion is that China's domestic renewable energy sources are abundant and show the possibility to cover future energy demand; the methodologies used to analyse a 100\% renewable energy system are applicable in China. Therefore, proposing an analysis of a 100\% renewable energy system in China is not unreasonable.}

It allows quite disaggregate energy and emission analysis: Global Energy System Model (GENeSYS-MOD) uses a system of linear equations of the energy system to search for lowest-cost solutions for a secure energy supply, given externally defined constraints, mainly in terms of CO2-emissions. The general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) version of OSeMOSYS is updated to the newest version and, in addition, extended and enhanced to include e.g., a modal split for transport, an improved trading system, and changes to storages. The model can be scaled from small-scale applications, e.g., a company, to cover the global energy system. The paper also includes an application of GENeSYS-MOD to analyze decarbonization scenarios at the global level, broken down into 10 regions. Its main focus is on interdependencies between traditionally segregated sectors: electricity, transportation, and heating; which are all included in the model. Model calculations suggests that in order to achieve the 1.5--2 {$^\circ$}C target, a combination of renewable energy sources provides the lowest-cost solution, solar photovoltaic being the dominant source. Average costs of electricity generation in 2050 are about 4 {\texteuro}cents/kWh (excluding infrastructure and transportation costs).},

  abstract = {Dozens of scenarios are published each year outlining paths to a low carbon global energy system. To provide insight into the relative feasibility of these global decarbonization scenarios, we examine 17 scenarios constructed using a diverse range of techniques and introduce a set of empirical benchmarks that can be applied to compare and assess the pace of energy system transformation entailed by each scenario. In particular, we quantify the implied rate of change in energy and carbon intensity and low-carbon technology deployment rates for each scenario and benchmark each against historical experience and industry projections, where available. In addition, we examine how each study addresses the key technical, economic, and societal factors that may constrain the pace of low-carbon energy transformation. We find that all of the scenarios envision historically unprecedented improvements in energy intensity, while normalized low-carbon capacity deployment rates are broadly consistent with historical experience. Three scenarios that constrain the available portfolio of low-carbon options by excluding some technologies (nuclear and carbon capture and storage) a priori are outliers, requiring much faster low-carbon capacity deployment and energy intensity improvements. Finally, all of the studies present comparatively little detail on strategies to decarbonize the industrial and transportation sectors, and most give superficial treatment to relevant constraints on energy system transformations. To be reliable guides for policymaking, scenarios such as these need to be supplemented by more detailed analyses realistically addressing the key constraints on energy system transformation.

  abstract = {The United States power sector is being transformed by the recent rise in the availability and use of unconventional natural gas, specifically shale gas. That transformation has already produced some of the most significant changes in the operation of the portfolio of electricity generation since WWII. Further implications are likely. To that end, we present results from numerical modeling of different United States (U.S.) power sector futures. These futures assess questions affecting today's natural gas and electric power markets, including the impacts of: forthcoming EPA rules on power plants, decarbonization options such as a clean energy standard (CES), potential improvements in key generation technologies, expanded use of natural gas outside of the power generation sector, and higher costs for natural gas production---assumed to arise from more robust environmental and safety practices in the field. The simulations were done using the ReEDS model looking out to the year 2050. ReEDS is a capacity expansion model that determines the least-cost combination of generation options that fulfill a variety of user-defined constraints such as projected load, capacity reserve margins, emissions limitations, and operating lifetimes. The baseline scenario shows strong growth in natural gas generation, leading to a roughly 2.5-fold increase in gas demand by 2050. Many other scenarios also see strong growth in gas-fired generation, highlighting questions about portfolio diversity, climate change, and research and development prioritization.}

  abstract = {As clean energy ambitions have expanded, critically evaluating renewable energy supply has become increasingly important to the energy research community and stakeholders. This study examines the onshore wind resource potential for the conterminous United States and its sensitivity to siting constraints and turbine technology innovation. We compile localized regulatory information and use high-resolution data to present multiple siting regimes covering relatively constrained to unconstrained potentials. Our efforts reveal high sensitivity to these variables and sizable uncertainty in the overall wind energy resource potential. Specifically, we find that siting constraints may shift the total capacity available to commercial wind energy by 2.3--15.1 TW. Furthermore, our results illustrate that technology advancement could require larger setbacks from buildings and infrastructure, reducing the total available capacity potential by 20\% relative to estimates using current technology, but that this reduction is largely offset by increased generation such that the net effect on generation is 1\%. The observed sensitivity to and uncertainty resulting from the variables we analyze suggest there is value in continued study and development of increasingly sophisticated approaches to characterizing wind resource potential.}

  abstract = {Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest in large-scale use of hydrogen in the transportation and renewable energy sectors. Relatively cost-effective storage options at scale are essential to realize the full potential of hydrogen as an energy carrier. Underground geologic storage of hydrogen could offer substantial storage cost reductions as well as buffer capacity to meet possible disruptions in supply or changing seasonal demands. Several geologic storage site options are being considered including salt caverns, depleted oil and/or gas reservoirs, aquifers, and hard rock caverns. This paper describes an economic analysis that addresses the costs entailed in developing and operating a geologic storage facility. The analysis focuses on salt caverns to illustrate potential city demand for hydrogen using geostorage options because (1) salt caverns are known to successfully contain hydrogen, and (2) there is more geotechnical certainty involved with salt storage as compared to the other three storage options. The main findings illustrate that geologic limitations rather than city demand cause a larger disparity between costs from one city to the next. For example Detroit hydrogen storage within salt caverns will cost approximately three times more than Los Angeles with its larger population. Detroit is located near thinly bedded salt formations, whereas Los Angeles has access to more massive salt formations. Los Angeles requires the development of larger and fewer caverns and therefore has lower costs.}

This pales in comparison to agricultural land use-- 30--38\% of ice-free land--yet future low-carbon energy systems that shift to more extensive technologies could dramatically alter landscapes around the globe. The challenge is more acute given the projected doubling of global energy consumption by 2050 and widespread electrification of transportation and industry. Yet unlike greenhouse gas emissions, land use intensity of energy has been rarely studied in a rigorous way. Here we calculate land-use intensity of energy (LUIE) for real-world sites across all major sources of electricity, integrating data from published literature, databases, and original data collection. We find a range of LUIE that span four orders of magnitude, from nuclear with 7.1 ha/TWh/y to dedicated biomass at 58,000 ha/TWh/y. By applying these LUIE results to the future electricity portfolios of ten energy scenarios, we conclude that land use could become a significant constraint on deep decarbonization of the power system, yet low-carbon, land-efficient options are available.},

This study focuses on the South West Interconnected System in Western Australia. Several high (90\% and 100\%) renewables penetration scenarios have been modelled, comprising wind and PV supplemented with a small amount of biogas, and compared with a ``like-for-like'' fossil-fuel replacement scenario. Short-term off-river (closed cycle) pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) is utilised in some simulations as a large-scale conventional storage technology. The scenarios are examined by using a chronological dispatch model. An important feature of the modelling is that only technologies that have been already deployed on a large scale ({$>$}150~gigawatts) are utilised. This includes wind, PV and PHES. The modelling results demonstrate that 90--100\% penetration by wind and PV electricity is compatible with a balanced grid. With the integration of off-river PHES, 90\% renewables penetration is able to provide low-carbon electricity at competitive prices. Pumped hydro also facilitates a 100\% renewables scenario which produces zero greenhouse gas emissions with attractive electricity prices. A sensitivity analysis shows the most important factors in the system cost are discount rate and wind turbine cost.}

The economic adjustment effects of long-term climate policy are investigated based on the cross-comparison of the intertemporal optimization models ReMIND-R and WITCH as well as the recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model IMACLIM-R. A number of robust findings emerge. If the international community takes immediate action to mitigate climate change, the costs of stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentrations at 450 ppm (roughly 530--550 ppm-e) discounted at 3\% are estimated to be 1.4\% or lower of global consumption over the twenty-first century. Second best settings with either a delay in climate policy or restrictions to the deployment of low-carbon technologies can result in substantial increases of mitigation costs. A delay of global climate policy until 2030 would render the 450 ppm target unachievable. Renewables and CCS are found to be the most critical mitigation technologies, and all models project a rapid switch of investments away from freely emitting energy conversion technologies towards renewables, CCS and nuclear. Concerning end use sectors, the models consistently show an almost full scale decarbonization of the electricity sector by the middle of the twenty-first century, while the decarbonization of non-electric energy demand, in particular in the transport sector remains incomplete in all mitigation scenarios. The results suggest that assumptions about low-carbon alternatives for non-electric energy demand are of key importance for the costs and achievability of very low stabilization scenarios.},

While all decarbonization pathways yield major environmental co-benefits, we find that the scale of co-benefits as well as profiles of adverse side-effects depend strongly on technology choice. Mitigation scenarios focusing on wind and solar power are more effective in reducing human health impacts compared to those with low renewable energy, while inducing a more pronounced shift away from fossil and toward mineral resource depletion. Conversely, non-climate ecosystem damages are highly uncertain but tend to increase, chiefly due to land requirements for bioenergy.},

  abstract = {Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP), the problem of deciding the new transmission lines that should be added to an existing transmission network in order to satisfy system objectives efficiently, is one of the main strategic decisions in power systems and has a deep, long-lasting impact on the operation of the system. Relatively recent developments in power systems, such as renewable integration or regional planning, have increased considerably the complexity and relevance of this problem. This is particularly true in the case of the European Union. These issues have motivated the appearance of a vast array of projects that propose specific development plans for the required transmission, together with academic literature that deals with the different theoretical aspects of the problem. It seems, therefore, pertinent to review these recent works and put them into context. This paper performs a critical review on TEP focusing on its most recent developments. It analyzes the current challenges to transmission planning and illustrates them with some instances of TEP in a European context. Then, it proposes a taxonomy of modeling decisions and solution methods for this problem, linking them to some of their main representative works in the literature with an emphasis on the most recent advances. These alternatives are critically compared, providing with insights that can guide researchers or practitioners when undertaking this kind of studies.}

  abstract = {The challenge of integrating fluctuating power from renewable energy sources in the electricity grid by the use of smart grids cannot be looked upon as an isolated issue but should be seen as one out of various means and challenges of approaching sustainable energy systems in general. Therefore, electricity smart grids must be coordinated with the utilisation of renewable energy being converted into other forms of carriers than electricity including heat and biofuels as well as energy conservation and efficiency improvements, such as CHP and improved efficiencies e.g. in the form of fuel cells. All such measures have the potential to replace fossil fuels or improve the fuel efficiency of the system. However, they also add to the electricity balancing problem and contribute to the excess electricity production and thereby to the need for electricity smart grids. The long-term relevant systems are those in which such measures are combined with energy conservation and system efficiency improvements. This article illustrates why electricity smart grids should be seen as part of overall smart energy systems and emphasises the inclusion of flexible CHP production in the electricity balancing and grid stabilisation. Furthermore, it highlights some recent developments in the Danish electricity market operation.}

The energy system analysis methodology includes hour by hour computer simulations leading to the design of flexible energy systems with the ability to balance the electricity supply and demand. The results are detailed system designs and energy balances for two energy target years: year 2050 with 100\% renewable energy from biomass and combinations of wind, wave and solar power; and year 2030 with 50\% renewable energy, emphasising the first important steps on the way. The conclusion is that a 100\% renewable energy supply based on domestic resources is physically possible, and that the first step towards 2030 is feasible to Danish society. However, Denmark will have to consider to which degree the country shall rely mostly on biomass resources, which will involve the reorganisation of the present use of farming areas, or mostly on wind power, which will involve a large share of hydrogen or similar energy carriers leading to certain inefficiencies in the system design.}

On the one hand, the cases reveal the lack of ability of organisations and institutions linked to existing technologies to produce and promote proposals and alternatives based on radical changes in technology. On the other hand, the stabilisation of the Danish primary energy supply over more than three decades shows that the ability to act as a society has been possible despite conflicts with representatives of the old technologies.

The possibility of integrating Renewable Energy Sources (RES) into the electricity supply is expressed in terms of the ability to avoid excess electricity production. The different sources are analysed in the range of an electricity production from 0 to 100\% of the electricity demand. The excess production is found from detailed energy system analyses on the computer model EnergyPLAN. The analyses have taken into account that certain ancillary services are needed in order to secure the electricity supply system. The idea is to benefit from the different patterns in the fluctuations of different renewable sources. And the purpose is to identify optimal mixtures from a technical point of view. The optimal mixture seems to be when onshore wind power produces approximately 50\% of the total electricity production from RES. Meanwhile, the mixture between PV and wave power seems to depend on the total amount of electricity production from RES. When the total RES input is below 20\% of demand, PV should cover 40\% and wave power only 10\%. When the total input is above 80\% of demand, PV should cover 20\% and wave power 30\%. Meanwhile the combination of different sources is alone far from a solution to large-scale integration of fluctuating resources. This measure is to be seen in combination with other measures such as investment in flexible energy supply and demand systems and the integration of the transport sector.}

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has examined possible scenarios for growth by 2050 resulting from the IRA and other emissions reduction drivers and defined several possible scenarios for large-scale wind deployment. These scenarios incorporate large clusters of turbines operating as wind farms grouped around existing or likely transmission lines which will result in wind farm wakes. Using a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model, we assess these wake effects in a domain in the U. S. Southern Great Plains for a representative year with four scenarios in order to validate the simulations, estimate the internal wake impact, and quantify the cluster wake effect. Herein, we present a validation of the ''no wind farm'' scenario and quantify the internal waking effect for the ''ONE'' wind farm scenario. Future work will use the ``MID'' scenario (more than 8000 turbines) and the ``HI'' scenario (more than 16,000 turbines) to quantify the effect of cluster wakes or inter-farm wakes on power production.}

Such strategies typically involve three major technological changes: energy savings on the demand side, efficiency improvements in the energy production, and replacement of fossil fuels by various sources of renewable energy. Consequently, large-scale renewable energy implementation plans must include strategies for integrating renewable sources in coherent energy systems influenced by energy savings and efficiency measures. Based on the case of Denmark, this paper discusses the problems and perspectives of converting present energy systems into a 100\% renewable energy system. The conclusion is that such development is possible. The necessary renewable energy sources are present, and if further technological improvements of the energy system are achieved the renewable energy system can be created. Especially technologies of converting the transportation sector and the introduction of flexible energy system technologies are crucial.}

It focuses on the consequences for infrastructures in terms of grids and storage across the electricity, gas and heating sectors. The hypothesis is that these consequences are rarely taken into proper consideration, even though the costs are significant and differ substantially between the alternative pathways. While the smart grid scenarios are based on electricity as an energy carrier, the ``smart energy systems'' approach is based on a cross-sectoral use of all grids. Using Denmark as a case, this paper shows how the current gas and district heating grids each have twice the capacity of the electricity distribution grid. Moreover, the existing gas and thermal storage capacities are substantially higher and the additional future capacities are more affordable than within the electricity sector. The conclusion is that the ``smart grid'' pathway requires a 2--4 times expansion of the electricity grid and significant investments in electricity storage capacities, while the ``smart energy systems'' pathway can be implemented with relatively few investments in affordable minor expansions of existing grids and storage capacities.}

We consider both supply and demand side measures. In addition to presenting energy system flexibility measures, their importance to renewable electricity is discussed. The flexibility measures available range from traditional ones such as grid extension or pumped hydro storage to more advanced strategies such as demand side management and demand side linked approaches, e.g. the use of electric vehicles for storing excess electricity, but also providing grid support services. Advanced batteries may offer new solutions in the future, though the high costs associated with batteries may restrict their use to smaller scale applications. Different ``P2Y''-type of strategies, where P stands for surplus renewable power and Y for the energy form or energy service to which this excess in converted to, e.g. thermal energy, hydrogen, gas or mobility are receiving much attention as potential flexibility solutions, making use of the energy system as a whole. To ``functionalize'' or to assess the value of the various energy system flexibility measures, these need often be put into an electricity/energy market or utility service context. Summarizing, the outlook for managing large amounts of RE power in terms of options available seems to be promising.}

Our results show that when using future anticipated costs for wind and solar, carbon dioxide emissions from the US electricity sector can be reduced by up to 80\% relative to 1990 levels, without an increase in the levelized cost of electricity. The reductions are possible with current technologies and without electrical storage.

  abstract = {The remarkable growth in deployment of grid-connected photovoltaics (PV) in recent years has, in large part, been driven by its rapidly improving economics. System costs have fallen almost fourfold in some markets over the past five years. The future success of the technology will, however, depend on the value that it can contribute toward delivering affordable, reliable, secure, and sustainable energy services to end users. PV has some highly valuable characteristics in this regard. It can be deployed at almost any scale from household to utility plant, typically generates at times of higher demand and hence higher value, and has very low adverse environmental impacts. However, its variable and somewhat unpredictable generation does raise some challenges within an industry aspiring to ensure that supply must meet demand, at appropriate levels of quality, at all times and locations across the electrical network. These challenges become greater as the penetration of PV increases. Energy storage is inherently valuable in a power system, but direct storage of electrical energy, and distributed small-scale storage, have to date played only a limited role in most electricity industries, although they have been widely used for off-grid applications. Growing penetrations of PV in grids will create both a greater need for energy storage, but also new opportunities for distributed direct storage to play a valuable role in the industry. These opportunities include better managing end user demand patterns and aggregated network flows, improving end user reliability and power quality, and sharing balance of system components between PV and storage equipment. This chapter explores these opportunities, highlighting the diverse range of potential value propositions from integrating PV and storage, identifying how these different values might be estimated for particular contexts, and providing suggestions on market arrangements that would facilitate these economic opportunities actually being achieved.},

Estimates of water factors were collected from published primary literature and were not modified except for unit conversions. The water factors presented may be useful in modeling and policy analyses where reliable power plant level data are not available. Major findings of the report include: water withdrawal and consumption factors vary greatly across and within fuel technologies, and water factors show greater agreement when organized according to cooling technologies as opposed to fuel technologies; a transition to a less carbon-intensive electricity sector could result in either an increase or a decrease in water use, depending on the choice of technologies and cooling systems employed; concentrating solar power technologies and coal facilities with carbon capture and sequestration capabilities have the highest water consumption values when using a recirculating cooling system; and non-thermal renewables, such as photovoltaics and wind, have the lowest water consumption factors. Improved power plant data and further studies into the water requirements of energy technologies in different climatic regions would facilitate greater resolution in analyses of water impacts of future energy and economic scenarios.

The reV model currently supports photovoltaic (PV), concentrating solar power (CSP), and land-based wind turbine technologies. Modules in the reV framework function at different spatial and temporal resolutions, allowing for the assessment of resource potential, technical potential, and supply curves at varying levels of detail. The platform runs on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) high-performance computing system, providing scalable and efficient performance from a single location up to a continent, for a single year or decades of time-series resource data. Coupled with NREL's System Advisor Model (SAM), reV supports resource assessments from 5-minute to hourly temporal resolutions and supports the analysis of long-term (i.e., year-on-year) variability of renewable generation (e.g., interannual variability and exceedance probabilities). Specific configurations of each technology (CSP, PV, or wind) can be varied across the analysis---e.g., a different wind turbine can be modeled at each location. The estimated generation and limitations put on developable land area---defined by the user---are used to calculate the technology-specific technical potential. For example, the user can limit the development by land ownership, terrain, land use/cover, urban areas, and custom inputs. Capital expenditures and operation-and-maintenance costs can also be specified by the user to represent current technologies or future cost scenarios for emerging technologies. The supply curve module is a spatial sorting algorithm based on plant siting, transmission cost, and regional competition, and it provides a geographically discrete estimate of the levelized cost of energy and supply (i.e., available resource capacity) for the renewable technologies modeled. The reV model currently provides broad coverage across North America, South and Central Asia, South America, and South Africa to inform national- and international-scale analyses as well as regional infrastructure and deployment planning. Potential and intended users of reV model outputs include utility planners, regional and national agencies, project and land developers, internal NREL modelers, and external researchers.}

We further compare more robust but data- and computationally-intense reliability-based estimation techniques with simpler approximation methods. We show that if implemented properly, these techniques provide accurate approximations of reliability-based methods. Overall, methods that are based on the weighted capacity factor of the plant provide the most accurate estimate. We also examine the sensitivity of PV capacity value to the inclusion of sun-tracking systems.},

  abstract = {Production cost models (PCMs) simulate dispatch of generators across a large power grid and are used widely by planners to study the reliability of electricity supply. As energy systems transition away from the thermoelectric technologies that have traditionally balanced electricity supply and demand, hydropower and its representation in PCMs is of increasing importance. A limitation of PCMs applied to continental power grids with diverse generation portfolios is that hydropower generation is simulated without full consideration of complex river dynamics, leading to possible misrepresentation of grid flexibility and performance. In addition, data used in PCMs may reflect outdated operating policies. In this paper we propose a hydropower generation feasibility test for PCMs. The approach uses a detailed hydropower model to determine whether the hourly hydropower schedule from a PCM with simplified monthly parameterization can be attained after accounting for realistic river dynamics and operating policies, such as spill requirements and general water movement and balance through a cascade reservoir system. We perform this hydropower generation test for the `Big 10' hydropower system on the Columbia River (part of the Western Interconnect of the United States), revealing 9\% overestimation of available hydropower generation in a PCM solution in an average hydrologic year. Our evaluation provides insight on the cost and opportunities for better representing hydropower in PCMs.},

  abstract = {The relative economic competitiveness of power generation technologies is a topic of much interest to diverse electric industry participants. However, assessing competitiveness can be challenging as it requires considering both total costs and total system value of each technology, which are complicated by the (1) numerous and diverse grid services needed to operate a reliable power system; (2) variations in the economic value of the grid services with system state and location, and over multiple timescales, due to the challenges of transporting and storing electricity; and (3) the unique characteristics of different electric system assets. Ideally, metrics designed or used to convey technology competitiveness must consider these complexities, but existing metrics often fall short. For example, the levelized cost of energy does not consider the system economic value of the various technologies nor does it consider services beyond electricity production. Various other metrics have been designed with the purpose of more-accurately communicating the economic viability of electric system technologies. In this report, we summarize the primary sources and components of costs and value and review the known competitiveness metrics by presenting their definitions, applications, advantages, and disadvantages. We also introduce a new set of competitiveness metrics, which we refer to as System Profitability metrics, that more-directly applies the economic principles of return-on-investment to electric system technologies. We use conceptual examples to show how the System Profitability metrics better reflect economic viability and relative technology competitiveness compared with existing metrics. We also describe how competitiveness metrics can be quantified using optimization-based models and demonstrate this capability using a U.S. electric sector capacity expansion model.}

As such, electrification-the conversion of previously fossil-fueled end-use processes to electricity-has been identified as a key pathway to a clean, reliable, and secure energy future. Electric vehicles are the most widely cited application of electrification, but technology improvements in electrically driven devices for buildings and industrial end uses, including heat pumps for space and water heating needs, induction stoves for cooking, infrared or ultraviolet curing processes, and electric arc furnaces for process heating, could lead to more widespread electrification across these sectors.}

We present the integration challenges of achieving this high penetration and characterize the options to increase grid flexibility to manage variability. Four high renewable pathways are modeled and demonstrate the robustness and diversity of renewable options. We estimate 69--82\% annual greenhouse gas emission reductions and 3\%--30\% incremental electricity price increases associated with reaching 80\%-by-2050 renewable electricity relative to reference scenarios. This paper affirms and strengthens similar analysis from the Renewable Electricity Futures study by using an improved model and updated data to better reflect investment and dispatch decisions under current outlooks for the U.S. electricity sector.}

  abstract = {Meeting the last increment of demand always poses challenges, irrespective of whether the resources used to meet it are carbon free. The challenges primarily stem from the infrequent utilization of assets deployed to meet high demand periods, which require very high revenue during those periods to recover capital costs. Achieving 100\% carbon-free electricity obviates the use of traditional fossil-fuel-based generation technologies, by themselves, to serve the last increment of demand---which we refer to as the ``last 10\%.'' Here, we survey strategies for overcoming this last 10\% challenge, including extending traditional carbon-free energy sources (e.g., wind and solar, other renewable energy, and nuclear), replacing fossil fuels with carbon-free fuels for combustion (e.g., hydrogen- and biomass-based fuels), developing carbon capture and carbon dioxide removal technologies, and deploying multiday demand-side resources. We qualitatively compare economic factors associated with the low-utilization condition and discuss unique challenges of each option to inform the complex assessments needed to identify a portfolio that could achieve carbonfree electricity. Although many electricity systems are a long way from requiring these last 10\% technologies, research and careful consideration are needed soon for the options to be available when electricity systems approach 90\% carbon-free electricity.},

This study applies an integrative approach that combines spatially-explicit resource potential analysis with high spatial resolution U.S. electricity system modeling. Multiple wind supply curves, representing variations in siting regimes that account for interactions with built infrastructure, regulatory, physical, and social land use factors, are evaluated to determine how siting could influence prospective wind development. Different siting regimes lead to variations in future wind capacity, with the greatest impacts observed under scenarios with high demand for clean energy. With the tightest emissions limit modeled, 2050 onshore wind capacity varied by +7\% (49 GW) in the least-restrictive siting regime to a decrease of 37\% (270 GW) under the most-constrained case. More-stringent siting restrictions lead to higher electricity prices and emissions that should be weighed with local impacts. Under restrictive siting regimes, wind deployment is also sensitive to transmission availability and wind plant design. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of local land use considerations in regional and national power system planning.}

This study assesses the aggregate impacts of state clean energy standards and emissions policies on national electricity generation, power sector carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and electricity prices and system costs. To do so, we apply the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) model, which is a detailed electric sector capacity expansion model, to evaluate scenarios with and without state policies and using a range of renewable energy technology cost projections. Across the scenarios analyzed, we find that the state policies drive 1.9\%--10.7\% of total nationwide clean energy and reduce cumulative power sector CO2 emissions by 2.6\%--5.4\% over the 2020--2050 study period. This incremental generation is predominantly, but not exclusively, from renewable energy technologies. In most cases, the state policies result in increases to electricity prices and electricity system costs, and policy costs are sensitive to the future cost of clean energy technologies. Across all scenarios, the levelized cost of incremental policy-driven clean energy generation is estimated to be \$17--38/MWh and the average cost of CO2 abatement from the state-level policies is estimated to be \$29--74/metric ton.}

The results indicate that the future U.S. electricity system that is largely powered by renewable sources is possible and the further work is warranted to investigate this clean generation pathway. The central conclusion of the analysis is that renewable electricity generation from technologies that are commercially available today, in combination with a more flexible electric system, is more than adequate to supply 80\% of the total U.S. electricity generation in 2050 while meeting electricity demand on an hourly basis in every region of the United States.}

  abstract = {Recent wind and solar deployment in the United States has grown at unprecedented rates, but the extent to which this growth will continue is a key question. Energy-economic planning models are often used to develop future projections of these technologies, and although it is well-understood that model outcomes are sensitive to assumptions about technology developments and market conditions, it is less clear how underlying model structures might impact outcomes. For wind and solar technologies, model structures might be an even larger driver due to the complexity required to represent their variability, uncertainty, and location-dependence. Here, we apply three state-of-the-art electric sector planning models to evaluate variable renewable generation under different conditions with both harmonized and native input assumptions to isolate the impact that model structures might have on deployment outcomes. We find growth in wind and solar deployment in all models under a business-as-usual scenario (without new policies), where the median value for variable renewable energy generation share is found to be 27\% by 2050---but with a wide range of estimates (18--43\%), types of renewable technologies deployed, and regional distributions across models. With harmonized assumptions about technology costs and market conditions the range narrows slightly, but a large range in penetration outcomes remains (24--41\% by 2050) suggesting that model representations play significant roles in projections of future wind and solar deployment. We also assess the implications of achieving 55\% wind and solar penetration by 2050---to assess potential challenges at higher penetration levels---and the magnitude of variable generation under a carbon-constrained future. Finally, we identify research needs to better assess the future deployment of variable renewable energy.}

  abstract = {Clean energy deployment scenarios typically assume a diverse mix of low-emission generation. However, because of historically low natural gas prices and cost reductions for onshore wind and photovoltaic technologies, recent new capacity deployment, especially in the United States, has come largely from these three generation sources. Here, we quantify competitive cost targets for three less-common zero-emission generation technologies---nuclear, concentrating solar, and offshore wind---under a range of future conditions. We determine the cost targets based on the technologies' system value, such that technology value equals or exceeds its cost. Using a capacity expansion model that develops system-wide, economically optimal generation scenarios of the United States power sector, we find that nuclear, concentrating solar, and offshore wind would need to attain levelized cost ranges of \$53--84/MWh, \$65--91/MWh, and \$39--77/MWh, respectively, to achieve 1\% additional grid penetration. We refer to this metric as the ``required cost,'' which is a technology's levelized cost of energy needed to achieve a specific penetration level. Higher penetrations lead to lower required costs as lower-cost generation is displaced. We estimate that to reach 10\% penetration, the required cost for nuclear declines to \$45--76/MWh. Because of resource variability and increased transmission needs for concentrating solar power and offshore wind, even lower costs are needed to reach higher penetrations: required cost ranges to achieve 10\% penetration are estimated to be \$30--56/MWh and \$18--40/MWh for these two technologies respectively. Our analysis informs research and development priorities and the design of policies supporting clean technologies.},

For long cylinders, we use the hydrodynamic equations for a crystal in one dimension. This is appropriate for stiff systems such as nanotubes, where the eventual crossover to a fluid only sets in at unrealistically large N. Despite the extra equation compared to a fluid, the scaling of the heat conductivity is unchanged. For strictly one-dimensional chains, we show that the dynamic equations are those of a fluid at all length scales even if the static order extends to very large N. The discrepancy between our results and numerical simulations on Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chains is discussed.}

  abstract = {Technical constraints related to power systems management may limit the high integration of variable renewable energy sources in the power mix. This issue is addressed for the Reunion Island, which aims to reach energy independence by 2030 using 100\% renewables. To that end, a long-term power system analysis is proposed using a comprehensive and coherent approach based on a bottom-up TIMES model providing future production mixes according to different scenarios. A transient reliability indicator based on kinetic energy is proposed and endogenized within the model. In addition, a dedicated Kuramoto model describes the synchronism condition required for aggregating the kinetic energy embedded in the whole power system. For the case of Reunion island, this methodology draws the following conclusions: (i) to achieve the 100\% renewables target, the capacity to invest in the energy sector is doubled, and the level of reliability decreases considerably; (ii) the loss of reliability induced by higher intermittency--- typically 50\% ---in the power mix can be counter balanced and leveraged by implementing flexibility solutions (demand response and storage).}

This paper answers where solar PV development has taken place in Arizona, how much suitable land is available for utility-scale PV development, and how future land cover changes can affect the availability of this suitable land. PV development suitability scores are calculated for the land across Arizona based on topography, location, solar resource and public opinion factors. Ground truthing is used to identify the scenario which best explains Arizona's PV power plant developments from several decision-making scenarios. Less than two percent of Arizona's land is considered Excellent for PV development. Most of this land is private land or owned by state trust. If the available suitable land is fully developed with solar PV, Arizona has the potential to become a regional energy hub. However, in the next few decades suitable areas for solar PV generation can get rapidly depleted due to conflict with growing urban areas. If the suitable land for PV generation is not set-aside, Arizona would then have to depend on less suitable lands, look for multi-purpose land use options and distributed PV deployments to meet its future energy need.}

  abstract = {Power sector capacity expansion models (CEMs) explore least-cost infrastructure trends under alternate techno-economic and policy scenarios. To maintain computational tractability when considering investment decisions over multiple decades, CEMs typically rely on a compact representation of annual hourly grid operations. Even as CEMs are being used to explore the role of variable renewable energy (RE) sources in the transition to a low-carbon grid, the required temporal resolution and operational detail in a CEM to adequately capture the fundamental economics of RE sources remains an open question. Here, we investigate the impact of embedding additional operational and temporal details in a CEM framework on the resulting projections for generation capacity additions and their utilization. Our approach is based on systematically comparing the outputs from a ``chronological'' CEM (C-CEM), which models annual grid operations using up to 12 representative days (288\,h), with outputs from a commonly used ``time slice'' CEM (TS-CEM), using seasonally-averaged time blocks. The CEMs mainly differ in their representation of operational flexibility of thermal generators as well as the temporal resolution of load and RE generation. Studying the Texas grid over a range of hypothetical RE penetration scenarios, we find that, more often than not, the TS-CEM estimates higher solar capacity and lesser wind and natural gas capacity relative to the C-CEM, with 35\% higher solar capacity projected by the TS-CEM in one scenario. We also test capacity projections of both CEMs through an hourly grid operations model to explore operational metrics, such as the ability to meet demand subject to intra and inter-annual variations in load and RE generation. This experiment reveals that C-CEM projections consistently lead to lower unmet demand compared to the TS-CEM capacity projections. These findings imply the need for sufficient temporal resolution and chronology or validated parameterizations that yield similar behavior to be included in power sector CEMs and multi-sector energy-economic models using a time slice representation.},

Here, we assess the holistic system value of energy storage in future grids with increasing wind and solar generation. We also identify the major sources of storage value and their dynamics under different system settings and at increasing storage and wind and solar penetration levels. We use a high temporal resolution capacity expansion model to study least-cost integration of storage in two variants of an abstract power system that is populated with load and VRE profiles consistent with the U.S. Northeast (North) and Texas (South) regions. For both systems, storage value originates primarily from deferring investments in generation capacity (VRE, natural gas) and transmission, and generally declines with increasing storage penetration. Increasing VRE penetration from 40\% to 60\% increases the value of storage, but only enough to make storage capacity up to 4\% of peak demand cost-effective at current Lithium-ion capital costs. With future capital costs of \$150/kWh for 4~h duration storage, the cost-effective storage penetration ranges between 4\% and 16\% of peak demand across the system scenarios studied here. Storage substitution of natural gas capacity is dependent on the VRE resource mix and penetration level, but is less than 1 GW per GW of storage added for the durations (2, 4 or 8~h) considered here. Increasing storage duration increases storage value in some cases, but this increase in value may be insufficient to compensate for the increase in capital cost per kW even under the future cost scenario.},

  abstract = {Expanding transmission capacity is likely a bottleneck that will restrict variable renewable energy (VRE) deployment required to achieve ambitious emission reduction goals. Grid interconnection and inter-regional transmission capacity may be reduced by the optimal sizing of VREs to grid connection or co-location of VRE and battery resources behind the grid interconnection, but neither of these capabilities are commonly captured in macro-energy system models. We thus develop these two new functionalities to explore the substitutability of storage for transmission and VRE resource trade-offs through 2030 in the Western Interconnection of the United States. Our findings indicate that not modeling co-location fails to capture the full substitutability of storage and solar photovoltaic (PV) resources for transmission: co-location can reduce long-distance inter-regional transmission expansion by 12-31\% and decrease grid connection capacity and shorter-distance transmission interconnection by 20-25\%. We also demonstrate that not modeling colocated storage does not accurately reflect competition between wind and solar PV resources and underestimates the value of energy storage: co-location of VREs and storage favors solar PV (4-5\% increase) and lithium-ion battery deployment (1.7-6 times increase), while decreasing wind buildout (0.9-1.6\% decline).},

The studied material is mainly based on peer-reviewed articles and the methodologies are classified according to which stage in the supply chain their main focus is directed to, as well as their scientific background. Our overview shows that a broad variety of approaches is used, but that there are still some important gaps, especially if the aim is to study energy security in a future-oriented way. First, there is a need to better understand how sources of insecurity can develop over time and how they are affected by the development of the energy system. Second, the current tendency to study the security of supply for each energy carrier separately needs to be complemented by comparisons of different energy carrier's supply chains. Finally, the mainly static perspective on system structure should be complemented with perspectives that to a greater extent take the systems' adaptive capacity and transformability into account, as factors with a potential to reduce the systems vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it may be beneficial to use methodological combinations, conduct more thorough sensitivity analysis and alter the mind-set from securing energy flows to securing energy services.}

Due to model performance constraints, these models typically do not explicitly simulate every hour within a year, but instead simulate representative time segments (groups of hours). This paper evaluates different approaches for selecting time segments across three methods: sequential, categorical, and clustering, across a wide range of time-segment quantities, for a total of 204 temporal profiles. To measure the performance of each profile's ability to accurately represent data, the root-mean-square-error of each profile's time segments are compared to the data's original hourly data. The temporal alignment across regions is also measured (i.e., how often windy days align across regions). Different spatial resolutions were applied for a subset of the temporal selection methods to investigate the impact spatial resolution has on performance. This paper provides a framework for measuring the value of different temporal selection methods and of adding more granular data to energy system models. Overall, multi-criteria clustering yields the lowest root-mean-square-error across all datasets evaluated and provides a holistic view of the intertwined relationships between renewable generation and electricity demand.},

In both scenarios, onshore wind power density in the US and Canada is predicted to drop. Under SSP5-8.5, the reduction is of the order of 15\% overall, reaching as much as 40\% in certain northern regions -- Quebec and Nunavut in Canada and Alaska in the US. Conversely, significant increases in wind power density are predicted in Hudson Bay (up to 25\%), Texas and northern Mexico (up to 15\%), southern Mexico and Central America (up to 30\%). As for the intra-annual variability, it is poised to rise drastically, with monthly average wind power densities increasing up to 120\% in certain months and decreasing up to 60\% in others. These changes in both the mean value and the intra-annual variability of wind power density are of consequence for the Levelised Cost of Energy from wind, the planning of future investments and, more generally, the contribution of wind to the energy mix.},

In order to explore the potential for a 100\% renewable electricity generation system with substantially increased levels of wind penetration, fossil-fuelled electricity production was removed from an historic 3-year data set, and replaced by modelled electricity production from wind, geothermal and additional peaking options. Generation mixes comprising 53--60\% hydro, 22--25\% wind, 12--14\% geothermal, 1\% biomass and 0--12\% additional peaking generation were found to be feasible on an energy and power basis, whilst maintaining net hydro storage. Wind capacity credits ranged from 47\% to 105\% depending upon the incorporation of demand management, and the manner of operation of the hydro system. Wind spillage was minimised, however, a degree of residual spillage was considered to be an inevitable part of incorporating non-dispatchable generation into a stand-alone grid system. Load shifting was shown to have considerable advantages over installation of new peaking plant. Application of the approach applied in this research to countries with different energy resource mixes is discussed, and options for further research are outlined.}

We show that a generation mix comprising 49\% hydro, 23\% wind, 13\% geothermal, 14\% pumped hydro energy storage peaking plant, and 1\% biomass-fuelled generation on an installed capacity basis, was capable of ensuring security of supply over an historic 6-year period, which included the driest hydrological year on record in New Zealand since 1931. Hydro spillage was minimised, or eliminated, by curtailing a proportion of geothermal generation. Wind spillage was substantially reduced by utilising surplus generation for peaking purposes, resulting in up to 99.8\% utilisation of wind energy. Peaking requirements were satisfied using 1550MW of pumped hydro energy storage generation, with a capacity factor of 0.76\% and an upper reservoir storage equivalent to 8\% of existing hydro storage capacity. It is proposed that alternative peaking options, including biomass-fuelled gas turbines and demand-side measures, should be considered. As a transitional policy, the use of fossil-gas--fuelled gas turbines for peaking would result in a 99.8\% renewable system on an energy basis. Further research into whether a market-based system is capable of delivering such a renewable electricity system is suggested.}

In this paper, the analyses and results of the design of a 100\% renewable energy system by the year 2050 are presented for a complete energy system including transport. Two short-term transition target years in the process towards this goal are analysed for 2015 and 2030. The energy systems are analysed and designed with hour-by-hour energy system analyses. The analyses reveal that implementing energy savings, renewable energy and more efficient conversion technologies can have positive socio-economic effects, create employment and potentially lead to large earnings on exports. If externalities such as health effects are included, even more benefits can be expected. 100\% Renewable energy systems will be technically possible in the future, and may even be economically beneficial compared to the business-as-usual energy system. Hence, the current debate between leaders should reflect a combination of these two main challenges.}

In this paper the focus is on how the heating sector can reduce its consumption of biomass, thus leaving biomass for other sectors, but while still enabling a 100\% renewable energy system. The analyses of heating technologies shows that district heating (DH) systems are important in limiting the dependence on biomass and create cost effective solutions. DH systems are especially important in renewable energy systems with large amounts of fluctuating sources as it enables fuel efficient and low cost energy systems with thermal heat storages. DH increases the efficiency with the use of combined heat and power production (CHP), while reducing the biomass demand by enabling the use of other renewable resources such as large-scale solar thermal, large heat pumps, geothermal heat, industrial surplus heat, and waste incineration. Where the energy density in the building stock is not high enough for DH to be economical, geothermal heat pumps can be recommended for individual heating systems, even though biomass consumption is higher than the DH solutions.}

This paper outline why and how to do so. Traditionally, significant focus is put on the electricity sector alone to solve the renewable energy integration puzzle. Smart grid research traditionally focuses on ICT, smart meters, electricity storage technologies, and local (electric) smart grids. In contrast, the Smart Energy System focuses on merging the electricity, heating and transport sectors, in combination with various intra-hour, hourly, daily, seasonal and biannual storage options, to create the flexibility necessary to integrate large penetrations of fluctuating renewable energy. However, in this paper we present the development and design of coherent Smart Energy Systems as an integrated part of achieving future 100\% renewable energy and transport solutions. The transition from fossil fuels towards the integration of more and more renewable energy requires rethinking and redesigning the energy system both on the generation and consumption side. To enable this, the Smart Energy System must have a number of appropriate infrastructures for the different sectors of the energy system, which are smart electricity grids, smart thermal grids (district heating and cooling), smart gas grids and other fuel infrastructures. It enables fluctuating renewable energy (such as wind, solar, wave power and low value heat sources) to utilise new sources of flexibility such as solid, gaseous, and liquid fuel storage, thermal storage and heat pumps and battery electric vehicles. Smart Energy Systems also enable a more sustainable and feasible use of bioenergy than the current types allow. It can potentially pave the way to a bioenergy-free 100\% renewable energy and transport system.}

Even if the costs of wind and solar PV decline drastically towards 2050 and the huge potentials that have been assumed in the literature are realized, the total system costs escalate significantly with very high shares of intermittent renewables. Since the use of hydrogen produced by excess electricity from renewable power generation sources can only make a slight contribution to reducing this escalation, it would be invaluable to introduce at least a significant amount of electricity generated by ``zero-emission thermal power'' technologies, including CO2-free imported hydrogen or conventional thermal power generation with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Nuclear power is also estimated as being effective in reducing the cost hike associated with achieving zero emissions. The results of this study could contribute to giving insights regarding global deployment of hydrogen-related technologies, as well as to presenting a frame of reference for Japan's future energy policies.}

As part of the EMF27 model inter-comparison exercise, we employ the MESSAGE integrated assessment modeling framework to conduct a systematic variation of availability, cost, and performance of particular energy supply technologies, thereby deriving implications for feasibility of climate stabilization goals and the associated costs of mitigation. In addition, we explore a wide range of assumptions regarding the potential degree of electrification of the transportation sector. These analyses allow us to (i) test the extent to which the feasible attainment of stringent climate policy targets depends on transport electrification, and (ii) assess the far-reaching impacts that transport electrification could have throughout the rest of the energy system. A detailed analysis of the transition to electricity within the transport sector is not conducted. Our results indicate that while a low-carbon transport system built upon conventional liquid-based fuel delivery infrastructures is destined to become increasingly reliant on biofuels and synthetic liquids, electrification opens up a door through which nuclear energy and non-biomass renewables can flow. The latter has important implications for mitigation costs.},

Yet fewer studies have explored the physical impacts of climate change on the power sector. The present analysis examines how projected rising temperatures affect the demand for and supply of electricity. We apply a common set of temperature projections to three well-known electric sector models in the United States: the US version of the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM-USA), the Regional Electricity Deployment System model (ReEDS), and the Integrated Planning Model (IPM{\textregistered}). Incorporating the effects of rising temperatures from a control scenario without emission mitigation into the models raises electricity demand by 1.6 to 6.5 \% in 2050 with similar changes in emissions. The increase in system costs in the reference scenario to meet this additional demand is comparable to the change in system costs associated with decreasing power sector emissions by approximately 50 \% in 2050. This result underscores the importance of adequately incorporating the effects of long-run temperature change in climate policy analysis.},

  abstract = {The most important energy development of the past decade has been the wide deployment of hydraulic fracturing technologies that enable the production of previously uneconomic shale gas resources in North America. If these advanced gas production technologies were to be deployed globally, the energy market could see a large influx of economically competitive unconventional gas resources. The climate implications of such abundant natural gas have been hotly debated. Some researchers have observed that abundant natural gas substituting for coal could reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Others have reported that the non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with shale gas production make its lifecycle emissions higher than those of coal. Assessment of the full impact of abundant gas on climate change requires an integrated approach to the global energy--economy--climate systems, but the literature has been limited in either its geographic scope or its coverage of greenhouse gases. Here we show that market-driven increases in global supplies of unconventional natural gas do not discernibly reduce the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions or climate forcing. Our results, based on simulations from five state-of-the-art integrated assessment models of energy--economy--climate systems independently forced by an abundant gas scenario, project large additional natural gas consumption of up to +170 per cent by 2050. The impact on CO2 emissions, however, is found to be much smaller (from -2 per cent to +11 per cent), and a majority of the models reported a small increase in climate forcing (from -0.3 per cent to +7 per cent) associated with the increased use of abundant gas. Our results show that although market penetration of globally abundant gas may substantially change the future energy system, it is not necessarily an effective substitute for climate change mitigation policy.},

Understanding the interactions between these technologies and their impact on the costs of stabilization can help inform energy policy decisions. Many previous studies have addressed this challenge by exploring a small number of representative scenarios that represent particular combinations of future technology developments. This paper uses a combinatorial approach in which scenarios are created for all combinations of the technology development assumptions that underlie a smaller, representative set of scenarios. We estimate stabilization costs for 768 runs of the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), based on 384 different combinations of assumptions about the future performance of technologies and two stabilization goals. Graphical depiction of the distribution of stabilization costs provides first-order insights about the full data set and individual technologies. We apply a formal scenario discovery method to obtain more nuanced insights about the combinations of technology assumptions most strongly associated with high-cost outcomes. Many of the fundamental insights from traditional representative scenario analysis still hold under this comprehensive combinatorial analysis. For example, the importance of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and the substitution effect among supply technologies are consistently demonstrated. The results also provide more clarity regarding insights not easily demonstrated through representative scenario analysis. For example, they show more clearly how certain supply technologies can provide a hedge against high stabilization costs, and that aggregate end-use efficiency improvements deliver relatively consistent stabilization cost reductions. Furthermore, the results indicate that a lack of CCS options combined with lower technological advances in the buildings sector or the transportation sector is the most powerful predictor of high-cost scenarios.}

It provides insight into the near-term and future solar-plus-storage market opportunities across the U.S. We explore the impacts of location, building load profile, technology cost, utility rate structure, and policies on solar-plus-storage economic viability, and identify which factors are most significant to project economics. While savings from storage-only projects are largely derived from demand charge reductions, solar combined with storage also provides significant energy charge savings. A common assumption is that load profiles with peaks are likely candidates for savings from storage, due to the opportunity for demand charge reduction. Our results indicate that potential for savings from combining solar with storage is independent of building load variability, likely due to the energy cost reductions from the solar. Systems are more often economical under time of use and demand charge rates, particularly when demand charges are {$>\$$}10 per kilowatt. Where systems were found to be economical, expected lifetime savings averaged between 7\%--10\%, with savings of 30\% in numerous cases. Near term markets exist for solar-plus-storage in locations such as California and New York. As technology prices drop, the number of building types that can benefit increase, and additional markets appear in Colorado, New Mexico, and Alaska.

This paper evaluates the utility of storage assets given different electricity system configurations, market paradigms, and management schemes using a production cost model. When a large share of non-renewable generation is derived from inflexible sources, storage is imperative even at relatively low renewable penetrations. At high renewable penetrations, storage becomes increasingly important in flexible systems as well. In addition to renewable penetration, storage utilization rates are sensitive to the storage assets' market bidding structure and ownership paradigm, particularly in inflexible electricity systems. Storage assets consume during low-cost hours and generate during high-cost hours, regardless of bidding structure, but the price delta is largest for a centrally-controlled storage asset bidding with a price arbitrage motive. Storage utility cannot be deduced from an individual metric, but rather depends on the interaction between bidding mechanism, renewable penetration, and system flexibility.}

SILVER optimizes the asset dispatch for a user-defined electricity system configuration that specifies demand response availability, generation assets, storage assets, and transmission infrastructure. SILVER has been applied to twelve Ontario-based scenarios to explore the implications of high VRE penetrations in a 100\% renewable scenario. The role that storage, demand response, electric vehicles, and transmission expansion might play in balancing VRE is analyzed. The results highlight the operational differences between balancing options: demand response, with a fixed price remuneration, is dispatched in proportion to net load curve variability, whereas storage technologies which take advantage of price arbitrage, are dispatched in proportion to marginal cost variability. GHG emissions fall with increasing VRE penetrations; however, there are local maxima when natural gas replaces nuclear generation, which interrupt this trend. Weak wind resources in the summer necessitate significant non-VRE capacity, which increases capital costs for higher VRE penetrations. Ontario planners have a number of interdependent challenges to contend with: integrating VREs on a nuclear-dominated system, mitigating wind's significant seasonal variability, and establishing effective remuneration mechanisms to improve grid flexibility.}

  abstract = {Water and energy are one of the most primitive and prominent needs of each society. Supplying these requirements to island residents is especially more complicated and costly due to limited access to the urban utilities. On the other hand, investment cost of the renewable energy resources is progressively decreasing. In this context, this paper model, design, and optimize a joint water and energy supply system for a remote island without access to the utility networks. Freshwater will be produced by means of the desalination units. Various desalination processes including reverse-osmosis, multi-stage flash, and multi-effect distillation have been considered and compared to select optimum method in terms of technical and cost factors. The required electrical and thermal energy demanded by the consumers and also desalination process is supplied by a hybrid solar-wind renewable system. A battery energy storage system is used to balance time period of the renewable energy production with the peak load demand. In addition, diesel generator units are considered to enhance reliability level of the supply system. Results of the simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach will optimally determine capacity and characteristics of the system components and also desalination method.}

Estimates were gathered through a broad search of publicly available sources, screened for quality and relevance, and harmonized for methodological differences. Published estimates vary substantially, due in part to differences in production pathways, in defined boundaries, and in performance parameters. Despite limitations to available data, we find that: water used for cooling of thermoelectric power plants dominates the life cycle water use in most cases; the coal, natural gas, and nuclear fuel cycles require substantial water per megawatt-hour in most cases; and, a substantial proportion of life cycle water use per megawatt-hour is required for the manufacturing and construction of concentrating solar, geothermal, photovoltaic, and wind power facilities. On the basis of the best available evidence for the evaluated technologies, total life cycle water use appears lowest for electricity generated by photovoltaics and wind, and highest for thermoelectric generation technologies. This report provides the foundation for conducting water use impact assessments of the power sector while also identifying gaps in data that could guide future research.},

In 2012, the U.S. has surpassed Russia in natural gas production for the first time since 1982. At the same year, annual average U.S. Henry hub natural gas spot price decreased to \$2.75 per million BTU, which was \$8.69 per million BTU in 2005. In 2013, proved shale gas reserves of the world is estimated at nearly 2.7 trillion cubic metres (tcm) and unproved resources at staggering 203.9 tcm. As a result, there is a global rush to develop most of this resource as possible. However, shale gas is no miracle fuel. It has been suggested that its effects on the environment could be worse than conventional natural gas. Fugitive methane emissions, groundwater pollution, and increased seismicity are amongst the most important potential environmental side effects. There is also concern about the accuracy of resource potential estimations due to lack of data and specifically designed shale gas reservoir models. Nonetheless, the analysis in this study clearly showed that without developing global shale gas resources we have to consume 66\% of our proved natural gas reserves to supply the demand till 2040. This would make most of the world natural gas importers, and rules of economy dictate that limited supply and increasing demand would skyrocket natural gas prices. Therefore, shale gas resource development is not an option but a must for the continuance of our global energy market and economy.}

Power systems must be assessed in order to identify and address component and system-level weaknesses while supporting their rapid restoration. This paper proposes a Bayesian Network (BN)-based framework to predict outages in an electric power grid that is exposed to a hurricane event. The inherent capabilities of BNs, including its intuitive and graphical representation of probabilistic information, and its ability to allow information updating with ease, make it an effective tool for this application. The framework is coupled with a DC-flow model that captures the physics of the electrical system and also reduces the computational complexity of building conditional probability tables needed in the BN model. The framework relies on component fragilities and topology of the grid, and predicts outages at substations and distribution points within the electric power system. Its application is demonstrated using Harris County's electric power system under the 2008 Hurricane Ike winds that battered the Gulf Coast of the United States. The model captured well the field system response, where low outage probabilities are observed in the transmission system while the outage risks at distribution load points are significantly higher. The developed BN framework can seamlessly integrate transmission and distribution systems, inform disaster management, and suggest restoration strategies, while supporting decision-making for pre- or post-event intervention actions.}

Inappropriate aggregation of temporal resolution can introduce substantial error into model outputs and associated economic insight. The mechanisms underlying the introduction of this error are shown. How many representative periods are needed to fully capture the variability is then investigated. For a sample dataset, a scenario-robust aggregation of hourly (8760) resolution is possible in the order of 10 representative hours when electricity demand is the only source of variability. The inclusion of wind and solar supply variability increases the resolution of the robust aggregation to the order of 1000. A similar scale of expansion is shown for representative days and weeks. These concepts can be applied to any such temporal dataset, providing, at the least, a benchmark that any other aggregation method can aim to emulate. How prior information about peak pricing hours can potentially reduce resolution further is also discussed.},

In the same vain, such capacity credits may be used in capacity markets to reflect the availability of an asset during periods of peak load. For storage technologies it seems that there is a discrepancy between the capacity credit that correctly captures the capacity contribution to the capacity target, and the capacity credit that correctly values the storage capacity. This is illustrated in a case study, which shows the differences in planning model outcomes when different capacity credit interpretations are used. Our results indicate that defining the capacity credit according to the contribution to the capacity target overvalues storage technologies, causing overinvestments. On the contrary, defining the capacity credit to reflect the value of the storage capacity, triggers the correct amount of storage investments, but underestimates the true peak reduction potential, which results in overinvestments in other firm capacity providers. In this regard, a novel iterative approach is introduced that leverages both capacity credit interpretations simultaneously to remove any bias in the solution.}

Because of the fluctuating electricity generation, storage technologies are needed to close the gap between demand and supply. Besides the electricity sector, the transport sector causes high energy demand. In this context, because of their remoteness, islands can be seen as blueprints for possible energy transition pathways. The objective of this paper is to analyse different principle concepts that come into question for a 100\% renewable subtropical island from the distribution system operator's point of view. This perspective offers the possibility to account all system costs needed to transfer a centralised energy system into a 100\% renewable one and to assume the macroeconomic costs of such a transfer. For the case of La Gomera the economic competitiveness of renewable energy, particularly solar PV and wind power, is shown. All evaluated sustainable scenarios lead to lower annual cost and primary energy demands than the business-of-usual (BAU) scenario based on the cost assumptions used in this study. The analysis underlines that the combination of different technologies will lead to the lowest primary energy demand and to the lowest annualised cost of 10.89\,M{\texteuro} for the entire island energy system, which is 37.2\% lower than a BAU scenario.}

Here, three DSM scenarios that vary in capital investment costs of technology retrofits were tested for the contemporary Northeastern US. These resulted in an 8.3--16.5\% decrease in summertime regional electricity consumption. The lower power consumption achieved through DSM was analyzed under an additional five SPR (strategic power reduction) scenarios to explore how the reduced electricity demand could be optimized through different modalities of thermoelectric power production that lower human health risks, thermal water pollution, carbon emissions or system costs (operation and maintenance) of power plants. SPR scenarios show potential to lower health risks to nearly two million people with corresponding avoided external costs of \$11 billion per year, lower carbon emissions (31\%, maximum) and thermal water pollution (37\%, maximum). By internalizing external costs, some unfavorable investments (NPV (net present value)~\&lt;~0) turned into favorable ones (NPV~\&gt;~0). Results show that integrating tradeoffs of DSM beyond the building scale unveil considerable social and environmental benefits that are ignored in typical financial valuations. This, in turn, can provide more holistic assessments and identify actionable policy alternatives of value to energy and environmental planners that aim to achieve sustainable development.}

These power-generating technologies both strongly depend on water availability, and water temperature for cooling also plays a critical role for thermoelectric power generation. Climate change and resulting changes in water resources will therefore affect power generation while energy demands continue to increase with economic development and a growing world population. Here we present a global assessment of the vulnerability of the world's current hydropower and thermoelectric power-generation system to changing climate and water resources, and test adaptation options for sustainable water--energy security during the twenty-first century. Using a coupled hydrological--electricity modelling framework with data on 24,515 hydropower and 1,427 thermoelectric power plants, we show reductions in usable capacity for 61--74\% of the hydropower plants and 81--86\% of the thermoelectric power plants worldwide for 2040--2069. However, adaptation options such as increased plant efficiencies, replacement of cooling system types and fuel switches are effective alternatives to reduce the assessed vulnerability to changing climate and freshwater resources. Transitions in the electricity sector with a stronger focus on adaptation, in addition to mitigation, are thus highly recommended to sustain water--energy security in the coming decades.},

During recent warm, dry summers several thermoelectric power plants in Europe and the southeastern United States were forced to reduce production owing to cooling-water scarcity. Here we show that thermoelectric power in Europe and the United States is vulnerable to climate change owing to the combined impacts of lower summer river flows and higher river water temperatures. Using a physically based hydrological and water temperature modelling framework in combination with an electricity production model, we show a summer average decrease in capacity of power plants of 6.3--19\% in Europe and 4.4--16\% in the United States depending on cooling system type and climate scenario for 2031--2060. In addition, probabilities of extreme ({$>$}90\%) reductions in thermoelectric power production will on average increase by a factor of three. Considering the increase in future electricity demand, there is a strong need for improved climate adaptation strategies in the thermoelectric power sector to assure futureenergy security.},

  abstract = {This article presents research that seeks to assist distribution network operators in the adoption of real-time thermal rating (RTR) systems. The exploitation of power system rating variations is challenging because of the complex nature of environmental conditions such as wind speed. The adoption of an RTR system may overcome this challenge and offers perceived benefits such as increased distributed generation (DG) accommodation and avoidance of component damage or premature ageing. Simulations, using lumped parameter component models, are used to investigate the influence of environmental conditions on overhead line, electric cable, and power transformer ratings. Key findings showed that the average rating of overhead lines, electric cables, and power transformers ranged from 1.70 to 2.53, 1.00 to 1.06, and 1.06 to 1.10 times the static rating, respectively. Since overhead lines were found to have the greatest potential for rating exploitation, the influence of environmental conditions on four overhead line types was investigated and it was shown that the value of an RTR system is location dependent. Furthermore, the additional annual energy yield from DG that could potentially be accommodated through deployment of an RTR system was found to be 54 per cent for the case considered.},

  abstract = {We explore the operations, balancing requirements, and costs of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council power system under a stringent greenhouse gas emission reduction target. We include sensitivities for technology costs and availability, fuel prices and emissions, and demand profile. Meeting an emissions target of 85\% below 1990 levels is feasible across a range of assumptions, but the cost of achieving the goal and the technology mix are uncertain. Deployment of solar photovoltaics is the main driver of storage deployment: the diurnal periodicity of solar energy availability results in opportunities for daily arbitrage that storage technologies with several hours of duration are well suited to provide. Wind output exhibits seasonal variations and requires storage with a large energy subcomponent to avoid curtailment. The combination of low-cost solar technology and advanced battery technology can provide substantial savings through 2050, greatly mitigating the cost of climate change mitigation. Policy goals for storage deployment should be based on the function storage will play on the grid and therefore incorporate both the power rating and duration of the storage system. These goals should be set as part of overall portfolio development, as system flexibility needs will vary with the grid mix.}

  abstract = {The United States Department of Energy's SunShot Initiative has set cost-reduction targets of \$1/watt for central-station solar technologies. We use SWITCH, a high-resolution electricity system planning model, to study the implications of achieving these targets for technology deployment and electricity costs in western North America, focusing on scenarios limiting carbon emissions to 80\% below 1990 levels by 2050. We find that achieving the SunShot target for solar photovoltaics would allow this technology to provide more than a third of electric power in the region, displacing natural gas in the medium term and reducing the need for nuclear and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies, which face technological and cost uncertainties, by 2050. We demonstrate that a diverse portfolio of technological options can help integrate high levels of solar generation successfully and cost-effectively. The deployment of GW-scale storage plays a central role in facilitating solar deployment and the availability of flexible loads could increase the solar penetration level further. In the scenarios investigated, achieving the SunShot target can substantially mitigate the cost of implementing a carbon cap, decreasing power costs by up to 14\% and saving up to \$20 billion (\$2010) annually by 2050 relative to scenarios with Reference solar costs.}

With the worldwide increase in wind power during the past several years, there is increasing interest and significance regarding its capacity value because this has a direct influence on the amount of other (nonwind) capacity that is needed. We build on previous reviews from IEEE and IEA Wind Task 25a and examine recent work that evaluates the impact of multiple-year data sets and the impact of interconnected systems on resource adequacy. We also provide examples that explore the use of alternative reliability metrics for wind capacity value calculations. We show how multiple-year data sets significantly increase the robustness of results compared to single-year assessments. Assumptions regarding the transmission interconnections play a significant role. To date, results regarding which reliability metric to use for probabilistic capacity valuation show little sensitivity to the metric.

High time resolution and operational constraints can be important to estimate the economic value of variable generation resources like PV, as is the use of a modeling framework that accommodates new investment decisions. The model is herein applied to a case study that is loosely based on California in 2030. The marginal economic value of PV is decomposed into the capacity value, energy value, day-ahead forecast error cost, and ancillary services. The value of PV is found to exceed the value of a flat block of power by US\$ 19/MWh at low penetration, largely due to the high capacity value of PV at low penetration. The value of PV is found to drop considerably (by more than US\$ 60/MWh) as the penetration increases toward 30\% on an energy basis, first primarily due to a steep drop in the capacity value followed by a decrease in the energy value. Day-ahead forecast error and ancillary service costs, although not insignificant, do not change as dramatically with increasing penetration. In the near term, efforts to mitigate changes in the value of PV with increasing penetration may be most effective if focused on maintaining the capacity value of PV.}

  abstract = {Energy storage is a leading option to enhance the resource adequacy contribution of solar energy. Detailed analysis of the capacity credit of solar energy and energy storage is limited in part due to the data intensive and computationally complex nature of probabilistic resource adequacy assessments. This paper presents a simple algorithm for calculating the capacity credit of energy-limited resources that, due to the low computational and data needs, is well suited to exploratory analysis. Validation against benchmarks based on probabilistic techniques shows that it can yield similar insights. The method is used to evaluate the impact of different solar and storage configurations, particularly with respect to the strategy for coupling storage and solar photovoltaic systems. Application of the method to a case study of utilities in Florida, where solar is rapidly growing and demand peaks in the winter and summer, demonstrates that it can improve on rules of thumb used in practice by some utilities. If storage is required to charge only from solar, periods of high demand driven by cold weather events accompanied by lower solar production can result in a capacity credit of solar and storage that is less than the capacity credit of storage alone.}

We use the same model and data, based loosely on California in 2030, to evaluate several options to stem the decline in value of these technologies. The largest increase in the value of wind at high penetration levels comes from increased geographic diversity. The largest increase in the value of PV at high penetration levels comes from assuming that low-cost bulk power storage is an investment option. Other attractive options, particularly at more modest penetration levels, include real-time pricing and technology diversity.}

As wind energy accounts for a greater portion of total energy, understanding geographic and temporal variation in wind generation is key to many planning, operational, and research questions. However,               in-situ               observations of wind speed are expensive to make and rarely shared publicly. Meteorological models are commonly used to estimate wind speeds, but vary in quality and are often challenging to access and interpret. The Plant-Level US multi-model WIND and generation (PLUSWIND) data repository helps to address these challenges. PLUSWIND provides wind speeds and estimated generation on an hourly basis at almost all wind plants across the contiguous United States from 2018--2021. The repository contains wind speeds and generation based on three different meteorological models: ERA5, MERRA2, and HRRR. Data are publicly accessible in simple csv files. Modeled generation is compared to regional and plant records, which highlights model biases and errors and how they differ by model, across regions, and across time frames.},

Many multi-interconnection or multi-region links had values of greater than \${\textbackslash}\$20\$/MWh, or up to \${\textbackslash}\$175\$ million/yr per 1 GW expanded transmission (subject to limits to the depth of the market at each side of the link). In contrast, many links within regions, or between regions in the northeast, had relatively low values in 2023, following the overall decline in wholesale electricity prices in 2023 compared with 2021-2022. The most valuable link in 2023, at \${\textbackslash}\$61\$ /MWh, was between Texas and the Southwest. Multiple events in 2023 (high natural gas prices in the western U.S., and high summer temperatures in Texas and the Southwest) were observed to have driven this high value. Of particular note, high prices in Texas occurred at a largely distinct set of hours from high prices in the Southwest, helping to drive up the value of transmission in total and demonstrating significant value to both regions. This example demonstrates the unique value of transmission (compared to other solutions, such as building local generation resources) in delivering benefits to multiple regions given its ability to connect areas of the country that inevitably face differing circumstances.},

  abstract = {The electric power sector is experiencing a rapid shift towards renewable energy resources. To accommodate this transition, the transmission system requires significant upgrades. Although enhancing grid capacity through transmission network expansion is always a solution, it can be very costly and requires a protracted permitting process. Grid-enhancing technologies (GETs) encompass a broad range of hardware and software tools that enable reconfiguration of the transmission grid and adjustment of its parameters. The proliferation of such technologies enhances transfer capability over the current transmission network, thus reducing the need for grid expansion. This paper offers a comprehensive review of grid-enhancing technologies. The paper discusses definitions of transmission flexibility and presents methods that are developed to quantify grid flexibility. The paper offers a comprehensive review of an extensive range of grid-enhancing technologies, including both principles of operation and state-of-the-art developments. Environmental impacts of grid-enhancing technologies, including renewable energy curtailment and carbon emission reduction, are also discussed. In addition to technical aspects of grid enhancing technologies, the paper also reviews the literature on the incentive challenges facing GETs adoption and efficient. Overall, the paper offers a comprehensive review of the advancements in grid-enhancing technologies, discusses the remaining critical challenges, and identifies directions for future research.},

To this end, we give an overview of the current energy policy and status of electricity generation and demand of two federal states: the capital city Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg. In a second step we present alternative, feasible scenarios with focus on the years 2020 and 2030. All scenarios were numerically evaluated in hourly time steps using a cost optimisation approach. The required installed capacities in an 80\% renewables scenario in the year 2020 consist of 8.8~GW wind energy, 4.8~GW photovoltaics, 0.4~GWel bioenergy, 0.6~GWel methanation and a gas storage capacity of 180~GWhth. In order to meet a renewable electricity share of 100\% in 2030, approximately 9.5~GW wind energy, 10.2~GW photovoltaics and 0.4~GWel bioenergy will be needed, complemented by a methanation capacity of about 1.5~GWel and gas storage of about 530~GWhth. In 2030, an additional 11~GWhel of battery storage capacity will be required. Approximately 3~GW of thermal gas power plants will be necessary to cover the residual load in both scenarios. Furthermore, we studied the transmission capacities of extra-high voltage transmission lines in a second simulation and found them to be sufficient for the energy distribution within the investigated region.}

  abstract = {Nuclear power holds the potential to make a significant contribution to decarbonizing the US energy system. Whether it could do so in its current form is a critical question: Existing large light water reactors in the United States are under economic pressure from low natural gas prices, and some have already closed. Moreover, because of their great cost and complexity, it appears most unlikely that any new large plants will be built over the next several decades. While advanced reactor designs are sometimes held up as a potential solution to nuclear power's challenges, our assessment of the advanced fission enterprise suggests that no US design will be commercialized before midcentury. That leaves factory-manufactured, light water small modular reactors (SMRs) as the only option that might be deployed at significant scale in the climate-critical period of the next several decades. We have systematically investigated how a domestic market could develop to support that industry over the next several decades and, in the absence of a dramatic change in the policy environment, have been unable to make a convincing case. Achieving deep decarbonization of the energy system will require a portfolio of every available technology and strategy we can muster. It should be a source of profound concern for all who care about climate change that, for entirely predictable and resolvable reasons, the United States appears set to virtually lose nuclear power, and thus a wedge of reliable and low-carbon energy, over the next few decades.}

Using the World Gas Model, a large-scale game theoretic model, this paper investigates the potential effects of U.S. LNG exports on the domestic and global markets. U.S. LNG export scenarios relate to a Global 20/20/20 policy and competition with new pipeline projects (e.g., Nord Stream, South Stream, and Southern Corridor projects) are also considered. We find that the average U.S. domestic natural gas prices increase approximately 10.9\% given 123 billion cubic meters of LNG exports and that natural gas prices in Europe and Asia decrease significantly. In addition, less expensive U.S. LNG is competitive in European and Asian gas markets and displaces more expensive suppliers in European and Asian gas markets. Under the European pipeline scenario, Russia is expected to reduce natural gas flows to transit countries by more than 50\% when the Nord Stream and South Stream pipelines become available.}

Overall, current emission prices will not provide enough incentive to meet stated emission reduction goals. Increases in emission penalties lead to increased transmission capacity. In all cases, the system requires significant dispatchable, low-carbon electricity to meet emission reduction goals and the flexibility of hydro resources provides significant system value. In addition to hydro and low-carbon dispatchable generation, the system requires significant investments in wind and solar in all scenarios.},

  abstract = {Evaluating competition between electricity technologies is challenging because it depends on both their costs and their values. While technology costs can typically be estimated from projections of the cost components---capital, fuel, and O\&M---estimating a technology's value is more complex due to its dependence on its contributions to multiple different grid services, each with prices that can vary substantially over space and time. In this work, using an electricity model of the contiguous United States, we develop relationships between relative value and share of total generation for major electricity generation technologies which, when paired with projections of technology costs, can be used to estimate technology competitiveness. We identify significant differences in the relationship between relative value and generation share for variable renewable energy (VRE) and non-VRE sources, but we demonstrate that all technologies require consideration of their dynamic values (in addition to cost) when evaluating competitiveness. In addition, we demonstrate that relative value of a technology is substantially impacted by not only its own generation share but also other aspects of the system state, in particular the mix of other technologies present in the system. Finally, we use the developed relative value re\- lationships in combination with projections of future technology costs in a coarse resolution model that competes technologies based on a comprehensive competitiveness metric: profitability-adjusted LCOE (PLCOE). We show that this simple representation of technology competition approximately recovers the generation mix from a detailed model, which is not possible using LCOE alone. Such an approach can be used to improve the repre\- sentation of technology competition in coarse-resolution models such as integrated assessment models, for which simplified metrics are often needed.},

  abstract = {Energy systems are undergoing significant change. Many countries have ambitions to increase the share of renewable energy in their energy mix. This development entails the challenge of incorporating an increasing amount of volatile energy supply and a higher number of energy providers on distribution grid level. The smart grid could be a solution for this challenge. However, the implementation of smart grid technologies is rather slow. In this paper, we examine which barriers exist for the implementation of smart grid technologies. Fourteen in-depth expert interviews were conducted and qualitatively analysed using the grounded theory approach. First, a dynamic definition framework of the term ``smart grid'' was developed that incorporates contextual factors. Second, barriers to the implementation of smart grid technologies were gathered. We identified (1) cost and benefit, (2) knowledge, and (3) institutional mechanisms as barrier categories. Third, policy implications were derived. We recommend (1) the acceptance of a diversity of solutions, (2) the acceptance of incremental change, (3) the implementation of a stable regulatory framework, (4) the alignment of interests of individual market participants with the entire system, (5) the definition of a suitable scope of regulations, and (6) the collection of problem-specific information.}

We use an indicator-based methodology to assess progress with respect to energy, environmental and socio-economic issues resulting from RE stimulus programs linked to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and review and analyze the emerging but scattered literature. Overall, our results indicate that stimulus programs have had a positive effect on the RE sector. This is despite the fact that they were originally planned to work in combination with a greenhouse gas `cap-and-trade' system, which has not been implemented. From the methodological perspective, our approach is resource-intensive and our analysis highlights numerous challenges, notably related to causality and additionality. Despite these limitations, this research improves our understanding of the broad effects and impacts of RE stimulus programs.}

  abstract = {Current grid resource adequacy modeling assumes generator failures are both independent and invariant to ambient conditions. We evaluate the resource adequacy policy implications of correlated generator failures in the PJM Interconnection by making use of observed temperature-dependent forced outage rates. Correlated failures pose substantial resource adequacy risk, increasing PJM's required reserve margin from 15.9\% to 22.9\% in the 2018/2019 delivery year. However, PJM actually procured a 26.6\% reserve margin in this delivery year, translating to excess capacity payments of \$315 million and an implied value of lost load of approximately \$700,000/MWh, a figure two orders of magnitude greater than typically used in operational contexts. Capacity requirements vary by month, with more than 95\% of loss-of-load risk accruing in July. Setting monthly capacity targets could reduce annual PJM procurement by approximately 16\%. We examine the resource adequacy implications of the ongoing replacement of nuclear and coal in PJM with combined-cycle gas generators, finding moderate benefits: approximately a 2\% reduction in capacity requirements. We identify modest resource adequacy risks from potential future climate scenarios, modeled as temperature increases of 1 and 2~{$^\circ$}C relative to our study period. Holding loads fixed, these scenarios increase capacity requirements by approximately 0.5\% and 1.5\%, respectively.}

Such systems could play an important role in the grid of the future, but our ability to quantify their potential impacts is hindered by (a) the inconsistent treatment of hybrid systems and (b) an incomplete understanding of which aspects of hybridization will have the greatest influence. In this article, we review the literature and propose an organization scheme for utility-scale hybrid systems in which electricity is generated from commercially available, renewable energy technologies, and electricity is the only output. Based on this literature review, we propose three categories for delineating systems that link multiple renewable energy and/or energy storage technologies: co-located resources (locational linkage only), virtual power plants (operational linkage only), and full hybrids (location and operational linkages). Proposing a categorization based on whether the systems involve locational and/or operational linkages reflects the fact that technology combinations do not represent a meaningful delineation. In addition, the categories are ideal for informing model development efforts, by identifying the unique characteristics that must be captured in adequate representations of systems that fall under each category. Our categories can also help inform policy considerations, as they delineate system characteristics that would introduce distinct permitting, siting, interconnection, and policy challenges. Therefore, we believe that our proposed taxonomy will help organize thinking and research efforts in a way that will enable consistent evaluation of the costs, values, and potential of renewable energy-based hybrids.}

  abstract = {Most current approaches to resource adequacy modeling assume that each generator in a power system fails and recovers independently of other generators with invariant transition probabilities. This assumption has been shown to be wrong. Here we present a new statistical model that allows generator failure models to incorporate correlated failures and recoveries. In the model, transition probabilities are a function of exogenous variables; as an example we use temperature and system load. Model parameters are estimated using 23 years of data for 1845 generators in the USA's largest electricity market. We show that temperature dependencies are statistically significant in all generator types, but are most pronounced for diesel and natural gas generators at low temperatures and nuclear generators at high temperatures. Our approach yields significant improvements in predictive performance compared to current practice, suggesting that explicit models of generator transitions using jointly experienced stressors can help grid planners more precisely manage their systems.},

  abstract = {With an increasing share of wind and solar energy in power generation, properly accounting for their temporal and spatial variability becomes ever more important in power system modeling. To this end, a high temporal resolution is desirable but due to computational restrictions rarely feasible in long-term models that span several decades. Therefore many of these models only include a small number of representative `time slices' that aggregate periods with similar load and renewable electricity generation levels. The deliberate selection of the time slices to consider in a model is vital, as an inadequate choice may significantly distort the model outcome. However, established selection methods are only based on demand variations and are not applicable to input data with a large number of fluctuating time series, which is a drawback for models with high shares of renewable energy. In this paper, we present and validate a novel and computational efficient time slice approach that is readily applicable to input data for all kinds of power system models. We illustratively determine representative days for the long-term model LIMES-EU and show that a small number of model days developed in this way is sufficient to reflect the characteristic fluctuations of the input data.}

Exploiting intermittent renewable energy resources demands power system planning models with high temporal and spatial resolution. We use a mixed-integer linear programming model -- SWITCH -- to analyze least-cost generation, storage, and transmission capacity expansion for western North America under various policy and cost scenarios. Current renewable portfolio standards are shown to be insufficient to meet emission reduction targets by 2030 without new policy. With stronger carbon policy consistent with a 450 ppm climate stabilization scenario, power sector emissions can be reduced to 54\% of 1990 levels by 2030 using different portfolios of existing generation technologies. Under a range of resource cost scenarios, most coal power plants would be replaced by solar, wind, gas, and/or nuclear generation, with intermittent renewable sources providing at least 17\% and as much as 29\% of total power by 2030. The carbon price to induce these deep carbon emission reductions is high, but, assuming carbon price revenues are reinvested in the power sector, the cost of power is found to increase by at most 20\% relative to business-as-usual projections.}

  abstract = {In this study we use a state-of-the-art planning model for the electric power system - the SWITCH model - to investigate the evolution of the power systems of California and western North America from present-day to 2050 in the context of deep decarbonization of the economy. We find drastic power system carbon emission reductions to be feasible by 2050 under a wide range of possible futures. The average cost of power in 2050 is found to range between \$149/MWh and \$232/MWh across scenarios, a 21 to 88 \% increase relative to a business-as-usual scenario, and a 38 to 115 \% increase relative to the present-day cost of power. In order to rapidly decarbonize, the power system undergoes sweeping change. Between present-day and 2030, the evolution of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) power system is dominated by the implementation of aggressive energy efficiency measures, the installation of renewable energy and gas-fired generation facilities, and the retirement of coal-fired generation. In the 2040 time frame, deployment of wind, solar, and geothermal power reduce power system emissions by displacing gas-fired generation. In the 2050 time frame this deployment trend continues for wind and solar, but is accompanied by large amounts of new storage and long-distance, high-voltage transmission capacity. In stark contrast to present-day operation, electricity storage is used primarily to move solar energy from the daytime into the night in order to charge electric vehicles and meet demand from electrified heating. Transmission capacity over the California border is increased by 40 - 220 \% by 2050, implying that transmission siting, permitting, and regional cooperation will become increasingly important over time. California remains a net electricity importer in all scenarios investigated. Wind and solar power are key elements in power system decarbonization, providing 37 - 56 \% and 17 - 32 \% of energy generated respectively across WECC in 2050 if no new nuclear capacity is built. In an effort to integrate wind and solar resources, the amount of installed gas capacity remains relatively constant between present-day and 2050, though carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is installed on some gas plants by 2050. The fleet-wide average capacity factor of non-CCS gas generation drops steeply between 2030 and 2050, reaching only 5 - 16 \% in 2050 for scenarios that meet the 86 \% emission reduction target.},

Accurately assessing the value of such a strategy is exceedingly complex and entails many uncertainties. This paper takes a first step toward such an assessment by estimating the impact of battery second use on the initial cost of PHEV/EV batteries to automotive consumers and exploring the potential for grid-based energy storage applications to serve as a market for used PHEV/EV batteries. It is found that although battery second use is not expected to significantly affect today's PHEV/EV prices, it has the potential to become a common component of future automotive battery life cycles and potentially to transform markets in need of cost-effective energy storage. Based on these findings, the authors advise further investigation focused on forecasting long-term battery degradation and analyzing second-use applications in more detail.}

  abstract = {Advances in technologies for extracting oil and gas from shale formations have dramatically increased U.S. production of natural gas. As production expands domestically and abroad, natural gas prices will be lower than without shale gas. Lower prices have two main effects: increasing overall energy consumption, and encouraging substitution away from sources such as coal, nuclear, renewables, and electricity. We examine the evidence and analyze modeling projections to understand how these two dynamics affect greenhouse gas emissions. Most evidence indicates that natural gas as a substitute for coal in electricity production, gasoline in transport, and electricity in buildings decreases greenhouse gases, although as an electricity substitute this depends on the electricity mix displaced. Modeling suggests that absent substantial policy changes, increased natural gas production slightly increases overall energy use, more substantially encourages fuel-switching, and that the combined effect slightly alters economy wide GHG emissions; whether the net effect is a slight decrease or increase depends on modeling assumptions including upstream methane emissions. Our main conclusions are that natural gas can help reduce GHG emissions, but in the absence of targeted climate policy measures, it will not substantially change the course of global GHG concentrations. Abundant natural gas can, however, help reduce the costs of achieving GHG reduction goals.}

  abstract = {As advanced undergraduate and graduate students in optimization begin conducting research, they must base their work on articles found in academic journals. However, there is often a gap between the levels at which a journal article and a textbook are written. Bridging that gap are tutorials on fundamental, yet advanced, concepts such as (i) algorithmic details of linear and mixed-integer optimizers, (ii) formulations that render models more tractable, (iii) descriptions of the mathematical structure of linear and mixed-integer programs, and (iv) manuals of modeling languages that enable quick implementation of formulations and of linear and mixed-integer solvers. This survey paper provides references to papers and reports whose purpose is to give overviews of linear and mixed-integer optimization. We also include seminal texts and journal articles on fundamental topics, and furnish references on applications whose implementation may have implications for more general problems with similar mathematical structure. We propose to guide graduate students to identify references that aid in their understanding of advanced journal articles and that help them write their own research articles.}

This paper proposes and analyzes different strategies using synchronous condenser (SC), synthetic inertia (SI) of wind power plant, and their combination to enhance the frequency stability of low-inertia systems under various scenarios and wind conditions. Furthermore, one of the SC models includes hardware of automatic voltage regulator (AVR) for better representation of the reality is implemented. The simplified Western Danish power system simulated in real-time digital simulator is used as a test system of low inertia to demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategies. The comparative results show that the combination of SC with AVR hardware-in-the-loop test and SI offers a better improvement not only on frequency stability (rate of change of frequency and frequency deviation) but also on the system synchronism under various operating conditions.}

What's neglected is the feasibility of integrating BESS into the existing fossil-dominated power generation system to achieve economic and environmental objectives. In response, a life cycle cost-benefit analysis method is introduced in this study taking into consideration three types of battery technologies, namely, vanadium redox flow battery, zinc bromine flow battery, and lithium-iron-phosphate battery. The objective is to evaluate the life cycle carbon emissions and cost of electricity production by combined cycle power generation with grid-connected BESS. Findings from the Singapore case study suggest a potential 3--5\% reduction in the life cycle carbon emission factors which could translate to a cumulative carbon emission reduction of 9--16 million tonnes from 2018 to 2030 from electricity generation. Grid-connected BESS could reduce the levelized cost of electricity by 4--7\%. A synergistic planning of CCGT and BESS could theoretically reduce the system level power generation capacity by 26\% albeit a potential increase in the overall capital cost at the current cost of batteries. The projected battery cost reduction is critical in improving the feasibility of large-scale deployment.},

The analysis shows how the mutual effects of substitution within both the supply and demand-side play an important role in constraining or enabling the penetration of shale gas into the energy mix. The study discusses multiple scenarios and helps guide policy making by identifying areas where, and the extent to which, climate policy can reinforce energy objectives in the U.S.}

The first three islands have small, standardized, centralized solutions (solar PV coupled with battery with existing diesel backup). An order of magnitude larger, Aitutaki will be implemented as a centralized solution in two stages, allowing detailed data collection and capacity building. An order of magnitude larger again, Rarotonga requires progressive planning and implementation including distributed generation, advanced control and integration, and sophisticated commercial structures.}

  abstract = {The Renewable Electricity Futures (RE Futures) Study investigated the challenges and impacts of achieving very high renewable electricity generation levels in the contiguous United States by 2050. The analysis focused on the sufficiency of the geographically diverse U.S. renewable resources to meet electricity demand over future decades, the hourly operational characteristics of the U.S. grid with high levels of variable wind and solar generation, and the potential implications of deploying high levels of renewables in the future. RE Futures focused on technical aspects of high penetration of renewable electricity; it did not focus on how to achieve such a future through policy or other measures. Given the inherent uncertainties involved with analyzing alternative long-term energy futures as well as the multiple pathways that might be taken to achieve higher levels of renewable electricity supply, RE Futures explored a range of scenarios to investigate and compare the impacts of renewable electricity penetration levels (30\%-90\%), future technology performance improvements, potential constraints to renewable electricity development, and future electricity demand growth assumptions. RE Futures was led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).},

In this paper the synergy between these technologies is further explored, determining the minimum penetration levels that allow fulfilling the climate and energy targets. Simulations for a case study of Portugal in 2050 using an electric vehicles smart charging approach show that a 100\% renewable energy based electricity supply is possible with certain photovoltaics and electric vehicles combinations and that the environmental targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions are just reachable with significant electric vehicles market share. The notion that vehicle charging will have to take place during working hours to maximize petroleum displacement is reinforced.}

  abstract = {Nuclear power is low carbon and reliable, but in recent years it has struggled to play a strong role in global plans for electricity generation in the 21st century. Many of those involved with nuclear power and environmental agencies see controlled expansion of nuclear plants as the most environmentally friendly way of meeting growing energy demands. In the UK policy makers must recognise concerns around severe accidents and radioactive wastes and balance these against the risks arising from other energy technologies. In addition, energy policy-makers must ensure that energy supplies remain affordable for all in society. How might new nuclear power stations help meet emerging policy needs? This second edition of Nuclear Renaissance: Technologies and Policies for the Future of Nuclear Power continues to examine the future of nuclear power in the contexts of economics, environmental sustainability, and security of electricity supplies. Fully updated with the latest technologies and concerns, this comprehensive guide illustrates the technical challenges and opportunities facing nuclear power.  This semi-technical overview of modern technologies meets the growing interest from scientists, environmentalists, and governments in the potential expansion of nuclear power. Various countries are starting to announce plans for new nuclear plants, either to replace those being decommissioned, to provide additional power or to contribute to the decarbonisation of especially challenging industrial activities. In the 2020s many commentators, once again, point to a renaissance just beginning.  Nuclear Renaissance: Technologies and Policies for the Future of Nuclear Power is essential reading for physicists, engineers, policy-makers, researchers, energy analysts and graduate students in energy sciences, engineering and public policy. Key features   Fully updated throughout, with new content on topics including the latest developments in fission and fusion energy, the global financial crisis of 2008/2009, and the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear accident.

The literature reveals that costs are coming down, but with large uncertainties on past, current and future costs of the dominating Li-ion technology. This paper presents an original systematic review, analysing over 80 different estimates reported 2007--2014 to systematically trace the costs of Li-ion battery packs for BEV manufacturers. We show that industry-wide cost estimates declined by approximately 14\% annually between 2007 and 2014, from above US\$1,000 per kWh to around US\$410 per kWh, and that the cost of battery packs used by market-leading BEV manufacturers are even lower, at US\$300 per kWh, and has declined by 8\% annually. Learning rate, the cost reduction following a cumulative doubling of production, is found to be between 6 and 9\%, in line with earlier studies on vehicle battery technology. We reveal that the costs of Li-ion battery packs continue to decline and that the costs among market leaders are much lower than previously reported. This has significant implications for the assumptions used when modelling future energy and transport systems and permits an optimistic outlook for BEVs contributing to low-carbon transport.},

This paper communicates key insights and conclusions from a larger study that conducted review work, policy analysis, and interviews with actors in the global CCS community (Varn{\"a}s et al., 2012). No judgment is made of the desirability of choosing CCS as a low carbon technology option, but if this technology is indeed pursued, four challenges are found to be 10 times greater than often recognized. These are; (i) a tenfold up-scaling in size (MW) from pilot plants to that of commercial demonstration, (ii) a tenfold increase in number of large scale demonstration plants actually being constructed, (iii) a tenfold increase in available annual funding over the coming 40 years and, (iv) a tenfold increase in the price put on carbon dioxide emissions. It is clear that the current development path will not fulfil expectations of CCS being commercially available at the end of this decade, nor will CCS be widely applied in time for significant contributions to needed CO2 emission reductions. CCS will only be developed if policymakers continue to favour coal based power generation while simultaneously developing stringent climate policy.}

  abstract = {Given the urgency to decarbonize global energy systems, governments and industry are moving ahead with efforts to increase deployment of hydrogen technologies, infrastructure, and applications at an unprecedented pace, including USD billions in national incentives and direct investments. While zero- and low-carbon hydrogen hold great promise to help solve some of the world's most pressing energy challenges, hydrogen is also an indirect greenhouse gas whose warming impact is both widely overlooked and underestimated. This is largely because hydrogen's atmospheric warming effects are short-lived -- lasting only a couple decades -- but standard methods for characterizing climate impacts of gases consider only the long-term effect from a one-time pulse of emissions. For gases whose impacts are short-lived, like hydrogen, this long-term framing masks a much stronger warming potency in the near to medium term. This is of concern because hydrogen is a small molecule known to easily leak into the atmosphere, and the total amount of emissions (e.g., leakage, venting, and purging) from existing hydrogen systems is unknown. Therefore, the effectiveness of hydrogen as a decarbonization strategy, especially over timescales of several decades, remains unclear. This paper evaluates the climate consequences of hydrogen emissions over all timescales by employing already published data to assess its potency as a climate forcer, evaluate the net warming impacts from replacing fossil fuel technologies with their clean hydrogen alternatives, and estimate temperature responses to projected levels of hydrogen demand. We use the standard global warming potential metric, given its acceptance to stakeholders, and incorporate newly published equations that more fully capture hydrogen's several indirect effects, but we consider the effects of constant rather than pulse emissions over multiple time horizons. We account for a plausible range of hydrogen emission rates and include methane emissions when hydrogen is produced via natural gas with carbon capture, usage, and storage (CCUS) (``blue'' hydrogen) as opposed to renewables and water (``green'' hydrogen). For the first time, we show the strong timescale dependence when evaluating the climate change mitigation potential of clean hydrogen alternatives, with the emission rate determining the scale of climate benefits or disbenefits. For example, green hydrogen applications with higher-end emission rates (10 \%) may only cut climate impacts from fossil fuel technologies in half over the first 2 decades, which is far from the common perception that green hydrogen energy systems are climate neutral. However, over a 100-year period, climate impacts could be reduced by around 80 \%. On the other hand, lower-end emissions (1 \%) could yield limited impacts on the climate over all timescales. For blue hydrogen, associated methane emissions can make hydrogen applications worse for the climate than fossil fuel technologies for several decades if emissions are high for both gases; however, blue hydrogen yields climate benefits over a 100-year period. While more work is needed to evaluate the warming impact of hydrogen emissions for specific end-use cases and value-chain pathways, it is clear that hydrogen emissions matter for the climate and warrant further attention from scientists, industry, and governments. This is critical to informing where and how to deploy hydrogen effectively in the emerging decarbonized global economy.},

Although project costs exhibit economies of scale over the capacity margin and economies of scope over the spatial margin, network expansion costs may not exhibit cost economies overall. That is, proportional increases in both transmission capacity and length (in miles) may result in a proportional (or even greater-than-proportional) increase in expansion costs. Moreover, large projects (high-capacity pipelines spanning long distances) likely require installation of compression horsepower, which has direct cost effects. My results suggest such projects exhibit significant diseconomies in cost structure. As a result, pipeline tariffs based on cost-of-service pricing likely present a disincentive for prospective pipeline customers to commit to long-term contracts---which are necessary for the pipeline to acquire regulatory permission to build---particularly for large, long-distance expansion projects. The implication is that cost-of-service pricing may inhibit network expansion, exacerbating congestion issues.}

In this paper, we describe the optimal integration of a CHP plant as a utility producer for a residential district, and the potential for combining CHP with photovoltaic power generation. Utilizing residential energy demand data collected by Pecan Street Research Inc., a smart-grid demonstration project in Austin, TX, residential heating, cooling, and electricity demand are analyzed and evaluated. These demands are then used to compute an optimal operating strategy for an integrated CHP/solar utility and the impact of photovoltaic generation on plant operation and operating profit is determined. We demonstrate that CHP is a viable means for providing district-level cooling, heating, and power to a residential district in a hot climate.}

In addition to batteries, load control technologies can reshape customer load profiles to optimize PV system use. The combination of PV, energy storage, and load control provides an integrated approach to PV deployment, which we call ``solar plus''. The U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Renewable Energy Optimization (REopt) model is utilized to evaluate cost-optimal technology selection, sizing, and dispatch in residential buildings under a variety of rate structures and locations. The REopt model is extended to include a controllable or ``smart'' domestic hot water heater model and smart air conditioner model. We find that the solar plus approach improves end user economics across a variety of rate structures -- especially those that are challenging for PV -- including lower grid export rates, non-coincident time-of-use structures, and demand charges.}

As a result, PV output is almost always prioritized over other fuel sources and delivered to the electric grid. However, PV curtailment is increasing as PV composes greater shares of grid capacity. In this paper, we present a novel synthesis of curtailment in four key countries: Chile, China, Germany, and the United States. We find that about 6.5 million MWh of PV output was curtailed in these countries in 2018. We find that: Policy and grid planning practices influence where, when, and how much PV is curtailed; Some PV curtailment is attributable to limited transmission capacity connecting remote solar resources to load centers; PV curtailment peaks in the spring and fall, when PV output is relatively high but electricity demand is relatively low. We discuss available measures to reduce PV curtailment as well as increasing PV curtailment in the contexts of evolving grids and energy technologies.}

  abstract = {The Danish city Frederikshavn is aiming at becoming a 100\% renewable energy city. The city has a number of energy resources including a potential for off-shore wind power, waste and low-temperature geothermal energy usable as heat source for heat pumps producing district heating. In this article, a technical scenario is described and developed for the transition of Frederikshavn's energy supply from being predominantly fossil fuelled to being fuelled by locally available renewable energy sources. The scenario includes all aspects of energy demand in Frederikshavn i.e. electricity demand, heat demand, industrial demand as well as the energy demand for transportation. The locally available energy resources are deliberated and an energy system is designed and analysed with an energy systems analysis model on an aggregate annual level as well as on an hourly basis. Particular attention is given to the use of geothermal energy in the area. It is shown, that the use of geothermal energy in combination with an absorption heat pump shows promise in a situation where natural gas supply to conventional cogeneration of heat and power (CHP) plants decreases radically.}

  abstract = {Local zoning ordinances across the United States have the impact of restricting development of energy infrastructure, including utility-scale solar photovoltaics. While these ordinances may be developed for legitimate purposes to protect public health and safety, they could impede or increase costs of power sector decarbonization. We quantify the role of utility-scale solar zoning ordinances on power sector decarbonization across the Great Lakes region (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin) by integrating 6,300 rural community zoning ordinances into a power system planning model. Relative to no ordinances, solar zoning ordinances reduce total potential deployment of solar PV by 52\% (or 1.6 TW) across our region. Currently, however, the biggest zoning barrier to deployment is zoning ordinances which are silent on utility-scale solar. Deployment restrictions translate to up to 4 GW greater investment needs and 5.6\% greater PV investment costs to achieve a 10\% PV generation target. Starker shifts occur at the state level, e.g. Wisconsin sees a 40\% reduction in PV investments due to zoning restrictions. Our results underscore the need for planning that aligns local zoning laws with state and regional goals.},

  abstract = {Ambitious actions focused on rapid defossilisation of today's energy systems require greater urgency, in order to avert unmanageable impacts of climate change. Transitioning to a cost-effective and carbon-neutral energy system in Nigeria and across the globe by the second half of this century is vital. This study explores a paradigmatic pathway to a fully sustainable energy system for Nigeria, by 2050. The research approach is to simulate a cost-optimised transition pathway towards 100\% renewable energy based power system for Nigeria, using a linear optimisation model. The model is based on hourly resolution for an entire year. The country researched is structured into 6 sub-regions. The optimisation for each of the 5-year time periods is carried out based on assumed costs and technological status until 2050 for all energy technologies involved. The levelised cost of electricity declines from 54 {\texteuro}/MWh in 2015 to 46 {\texteuro}/MWh in 2050 for the power sector in the Best Policy Scenario and further declines to 35 {\texteuro}/MWh with sector coupling. Whereas, the cost of electricity increased to 75 {\texteuro}/MWh in the Current Policy Scenario without greenhouse gas emission cost. The results clearly reveal that integrating a renewable energy technology mix with a wide variety of storage technologies is the most competitive and least cost electricity option for Nigeria in the mid-term future, as indicated by the Best Policy Scenario. In particular, the compatibility and predominant role of solar photovoltaics and batteries is paramount towards a rapid transition of Nigeria's power sector, due to highly favourable economics. This study concludes with the implications of a stable and supportive policy environment, transitioning to a defossiliated energy system in Nigeria could be achieved in the mid-term future. This study is the first of its kind in full hourly resolution for Nigeria, and demonstrates the need for carrying out detailed analyses in examining gaps in energy transition understanding based on various policy constraints for developing countries in comparable climates.}

  abstract = {The idea of damming the Congo River has persisted for decades. The Grand Inga project, of up to 42 GW power generation capacity, can only be justified as part of a regional energy master plan for Africa, to bridge the energy gap on the continent. Proponents of very large dams have often exaggerated potential multiple benefits of a mega dam, marginalise environmental concerns and neglect the true risk of such projects, in particular for the fragile economies of developing countries. Studies have reported the financial risks, cost overruns and schedule spills associated with very large dams. In addition, most of the dams in the region are poorly managed. Therefore, the type and scale of Grand Inga is not the solution for millions of not yet electrified people in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this research, scenarios are defined based on announced costs and expected costs. Cost escalations in the range from 5\% to 100\% for the Inga project in 2030 and 2040 are considered, as average cost overruns are typically at about 70\% or higher for similar mega-dams. It was found that when the cost overrun for the Grand Inga project exceeds 35\% and -5\% for 2030 and 2040 assumptions, respectively, the project becomes economically non-beneficial. In all scenarios, Sub-Saharan Africa can mainly be powered by solar photovoltaics to cover the electricity demand and complemented by wind energy, supported by batteries. Hydropower and biomass-based electricity can serve as complementary resources. The grid frequency stability of the power system is analysed and discussed in the paper. Benefits of the Inga hydropower project have to be increasingly questioned, in particular due to the fast cost decline of solar photovoltaics and batteries.},

  abstract = {Major cost concepts used for evaluation of carbon policy are considered, including change in GDP, change in consumption, change in welfare, energy system cost, and area under marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve. The issues associated with the use of these concepts are discussed. We use the results from the models that participated in the European Energy Modeling Forum (EMF28) study to illustrate the cost concepts. There is substantial variability in the estimates of costs between the models, with some models showing substantial costs and some models reporting benefits from mitigation in some scenarios. Because impacts of a policy are evaluated as changes from a reference scenario, it is important to define a reference scenario. MAC cost measures tend to exclude existing distortions in the economy, while existing energy taxes and subsidies are substantial in many countries. We discuss that carbon prices are inadequate measures of the policy costs. We conclude that changes in macroeconomic consumption or welfare are the most appropriate measures of policy costs.}

However, many questions are still under discussion; for instance the relevance of the different technologies such as photovoltaic systems and wind energy converters installed offshore in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Concerns also exist about the cost of a future energy system mainly based on renewable energy. In the work presented here we tried to answer some of those questions. Guiding questions for this study were: (1) is it possible to meet the German energy demand with 100\% renewable energy, considering the available technical potential of the main renewable energy resources? (2) what is the overall annual cost of such an energy system once it has been implemented? (3) what is the best combination of renewable energy converters, storage units, energy converters and energy-saving measures? In order to answer these questions, we carried out many simulation calculations using REMod-D, a model we developed for this purpose. This model is described in Part I of this publication. To date this model covers only part of the energy system, namely the electricity and heat sectors, which correspond to about 62\% of Germany's current energy demand. The main findings of our work indicate that it is possible to meet the total electricity and heat demand (space heating, hot water) of the entire building sector with 100\% renewable energy within the given technical limits. This is based on the assumption that the heat demand of the building sector is significantly reduced by at least 60\% or more compared to today's demand. Another major result of our analysis shows that -- once the transformation of the energy system has been completed -- supplying electricity and heat only from renewables is no more expensive than the existing energy supply.}

Over the same scale, the annual storage cost decreases from {\textasciitilde}\$17/kg-H2 to {\textasciitilde}\$3/kg-H2. Like salt caverns, the installed capital cost of lined rock caverns decreases from {\textasciitilde}\$160/kg-H2 at 100~t-H2 stored to {$<\$$}44/kg-H2 at 3000~t-H2 stored. Storing {$>$}750-t useable H2 requires multiple caverns. The cost of salt caverns scales more favorably with size because the salt caverns are larger than lined rock caverns and need to be added at a slower rate as the storage capacity is increased.}

  abstract = {The deployment of renewable energy is considered as one of the important alternative solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by electricity generation. As one of the key measures for promoting the deployment of renewable energy, the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), which obligates power operators with a power equipment capacity of 500 MW or larger (excluding renewable energy equipment) to supply over a specific portion of their total electricity generation output in the form of renewable energy, was enacted in South Korea in 2012. However, there are still many disputes concerning the appropriate renewable energy deployment goal and the optimum portfolio for each renewable energy source which enable to minimize the economic burden while achieving the deployment target. Therefore, this paper intends to deduce the optimum portfolio up to 2050 based on explicit representation of renewable energy technologies and analyze the cost effect using the bottom--up energy system analysis model of electricity generation sector in South Korea. The result indicates that the potential for a reduction of the cost of PV was the highest and that, in the long term, it would account for the highest portion of the renewable energy portfolio as it was the most cost competitive technology. The additional cost for increasing the renewable deployment target 20\% compared with the 3rd Energy Basic Plan was predicted to be between 107 and 115 USD/MW h. Therefore the renewable energy will be able to play a greater role in reducing GHG emission if the R\&amp;D to reduce investment and operation cost of PV and wind power is conducted successfully.}

This paper focuses on 4 h energy limited resources with daily dispatch. The method modifies well-established effective load carrying capability methodology by optimally allocating limited capacity to the highest loss of load hours. Subsequent energy limited resources are iteratively stacked upon the prior solution, creating a marginal capacity credit curve with increased penetration of energy limited resources. Two systems are tested using this method. The initial capacity credit depends on system characteristics such as load and renewable penetration. Regardless, the capacity credit for energy limited resources declines steeply with penetration.}

We propose two novel approaches to improve the representation of residential heat pumps: Coefficients of performance (COPs) are modelled as dependent on air and ground temperature while installation of ground-source heat pumps is constrained by available ground area. In this study, TIMES-DK model is utilised to test the effects of improved modelling of residential heat pumps on the Danish energy system until 2050. The analysis of the Danish energy system was done for politically agreed targets which include: at least 50\% of electricity consumption from wind power starting from 2020, fossil fuel free heat and power sector from 2035 and 100\% renewable energy system starting from 2050. Residential heat pumps supply around 25\% of total residential heating demand after 2035. The improved modelling of residential heat pumps proved to have influence on the results. First, it would be optimal to invest in more ground-source heat pumps, but there is not enough available ground area. Second, the total system costs are higher when COPs are modelled as temperature-dependent compared to fixed COPs over a year.}

Real-life examples of highly renewable and sustainable island energy systems can be found all over the World. Islands on small geographic proximity provide the potential for the development of 100\% renewable island energy systems by exploiting their grid interconnections. This paper proposes that interconnections of a group of islands can be used to integrate the production from locally available renewable energy sources. Besides interconnection, electric vehicles were used as a demand response technology to provide storage for electrical energy from variable sources. Electric vehicles were connected to the grid using smart charging systems (vehicle-to-grid). In addition, stationary batteries were explored in sub-scenarios for the year 2035. This enabled to analyse the influence of the battery location through two main different scenarios, i.e. one big central battery and several smaller distributed batteries. Scenarios with different integration dynamic of variable renewable energy sources and electrical vehicles were modelled with EnergyPLAN model, while the interconnection analysis was carried out with the MultiNode tool expansion. The results showed that the interconnections increased the share of energy from renewable energy sources in the final energy consumption and declined the total critical excess electricity production, while vehicle to grid technology enabled exploitation of synergies between sectors.}

  abstract = {Using a high-resolution planning model of the Great Britain power system and 25years of simulated wind and PV generation data, this study compares different methods to reduce time resolution of energy models to increase their computational tractability: downsampling, clustering, and heuristics. By comparing model results in terms of costs and installed capacities across different methods, this study shows that the best method depends heavily on input data and the setup of model constraints. This implies that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to the problem of time step reduction, but heuristic approaches appear promising. In addition, the 25years of time series demonstrate considerable inter-year variability in wind and PV power output. This further complicates the problem of time detail in energy models as it suggests long time series are necessary. Model results with high shares of PV and wind generation using a single or few years of data are likely unreliable. Better modeling and planning methods are required to determine robust scenarios with high shares of variable renewables. The methods are implemented in the freely available open-source modeling framework Calliope.}

  abstract = {Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) is a smart grid technology that allows the rating of power line conductor to be based on its real-time temperature. Currently, conductors are generally given a conservative static rating based on near worst case weather conditions. Using historical weather data collected over a test bed area in Idaho, we demonstrate there is often additional transmission capacity not being utilized under the current static rating practice. We investigate a DLR method that employs computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to determine wind conditions along transmission lines in dense intervals. Simulated wind conditions are then used to calculate real-time conductor temperature under changing weather conditions. In calculating the conductor temperature and then inferring the ampacity, we use both a steady-state and transient calculation procedure. Under low wind conditions, the steady-state assumption predicts higher conductor temperatures which could lead to unnecessary curtailments, whereas the transient calculations produce temperatures that can be significantly lower, implying the availability of additional transmission capacity. Equally important, we demonstrate that capturing the wind direction variability in the simulations is critical in estimating conductor temperatures accurately.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the design and implementation of a proof-of-concept Pacific dc Intertie (PDCI) wide area damping controller and includes system test results on the North American Western Interconnection (WI). To damp inter-area oscillations, the controller modulates the power transfer of the PDCI, a {\textpm}500 kV dc transmission line in the WI. The control system utilizes real-time phasor measurement unit (PMU) feedback to construct a commanded power signal which is added to the scheduled power flow for the PDCI. After years of design, simulations, and development, this controller has been implemented in hardware and successfully tested in both open and closed-loop operation. The most important design specifications were safe, reliable performance, no degradation of any system modes in any circumstances, and improve damping to the controllable modes in the WI. The main finding is that the controller adds significant damping to the modes of the WI and does not adversely affect the system response in any of the test cases. The primary contribution of this paper, to the state of the art research, is the design methods and test results of the first North American real-time control system that uses wide area PMU feedback.},

  abstract = {Photovoltaics (PV) has recently undergone impressive growth and substantial cost decreases, while deployment for concentrating solar power (CSP) has been much slower. As the share of PV rises, the challenge of system integration will increase. This favors CSP, which can be combined with thermal storage and co-firing to reduce variability. It is thus an open question how important solar power will be for achieving climate mitigation targets, and which solar technology will be dominant in the long-term. We address these questions with the state-of-the-art integrated energy-economy-climate model REMIND 1.5, which embodies an advanced representation of the most important drivers of solar deployment. We derive up-to-date values for current and future costs of solar technologies. We calculate a consistent global resource potential dataset for both CSP and PV, aggregated to country-level. We also present a simplified representation of system integration costs of variable renewable energies, suitable for large-scale energy-economy-models. Finally, we calculate a large number of scenarios and perform a sensitivity study to analyze how robust our results are towards future cost reductions of PV and CSP. The results show that solar power becomes the dominant electricity source in a scenario limiting global warming to 2 {$^\circ$}C, with PV and CSP together supplying 48\% of total 2010--2100 electricity. Solar technologies have a stabilizing effect on electricity price: if both solar technologies are excluded in a climate policy scenario, electricity prices rise much higher than in the case with full technology availability. We also analyze the competition between PV and CSP: PV is cheaper on a direct technology basis and is thus deployed earlier, but at high supply shares the PV integration costs become so high that CSP gains a competitive advantage and is rapidly developed, eventually overtaking PV. Even in the most pessimistic scenario of our sensitivity study with no further cost reductions, CSP and PV still supply 19\% of 2010--2100 electricity. We conclude that if a stringent climate target of 2 {$^\circ$}C is to be met cost-efficiently, solar power will play a paramount role in the long-term transformation of the electricity system.}

The study considers measured hourly data of the electricity demand in Sicily (Italy), as well as the electricity generation from photovoltaic plants and wind turbines. The cost optimal design of the aggregated energy system is performed by formulating and solving a mixed integer linear programming model including design and operational variables. Results show that the configuration with the hybrid storage (hydrogen~+~batteries) solution achieves the lowest cost of electricity. However, the economic advantage compared to the design case with batteries depends mainly on the H2 storage cost. If H2 is stored in pressurized tanks, the cost saving compared to the use of batteries is limited (215 {\texteuro}/MWh vs. 213 {\texteuro}/MWh in the current scenario, 123 {\texteuro}/MWh vs. 128 {\texteuro}/MWh with 2050 projections). The cost saving becomes considerable if a more economic geological H2 storage system is available: 192 {\texteuro}/MWh vs. 213 {\texteuro}/MWh in the current scenario, 97 {\texteuro}/MWh vs. 128 {\texteuro}/MWh for the 2050 scenario.}

A common approach uses an integrated assessment model (IAM) to simulate time paths for the atmospheric CO2 concentration, its impact on temperature, and resulting reductions in GDP. I have argued that IAMs have deficiencies that make them poorly suited for this job, but what is the alternative? I present an approach to estimating an average SCC, which I argue can be a useful guide for policy. I rely on a survey of experts to elicit opinions regarding (1) probabilities of alternative economic outcomes of climate change, but not the causes of those outcomes; and (2) the reduction in emissions required to avert an extreme outcome, i.e., a large climate-induced reduction in GDP. The average SCC is the ratio of the present value of lost GDP from an extreme outcome to the total emission reduction needed to avert that outcome. I discuss the survey instrument, explain how experts were identified, and present results. I obtain SCC estimates of \$200/mt or higher, but the variation across experts is large. Trimming outliers and focusing on experts who expressed a high degree of confidence in their answers yields lower SCCs, \$80 to \$100/mt, but still well above the IAM-based estimates used by the U.S. government.}

However, the validity of these time-period aggregation approaches to determine the capacity expansion plan of future power systems is arguable, as they fail to capture properly the mid-terms dynamics of renewable power generation and to model accurately the operation of electricity storage. In this paper, we propose a new time-period clustering method that overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks by maintaining the chronology of the input time series throughout the whole planning horizon. Thus, the proposed method can correctly assess the economic value of combining renewable power generation with interday storage devices. Numerical results from a test case based on the European electricity network show that our method provides more efficient capacity expansion plans than existing methods while requiring similar computational needs.}

A central ingredient of this study is a sophisticated model for the hourly electric load demand in {$>$}160 countries. To guarantee matching of load demand in each hour, the volatile primary energy sources are complemented by three electricity storage options: batteries, high-temperature thermal energy storage coupled with steam turbine, and renewable power methane (generated via the Power to Gas process) which is reconverted to electricity in gas turbines. The study determines -- on a global grid with 1{$^\circ$}x1{$^\circ$} resolution -- the required power plant and storage capacities as well as the hourly dispatch for a 100\% renewable electricity supply under the constraint of minimized total system cost (LCOE). Aggregating the results on a national level results in an levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) range of 80-200 EUR/MWh (on a projected cost basis for the year 2020) in this very decentralized approach. As a global average, 142 EUR/MWh are found. Due to the restricted number of technologies considered here, this represents an upper limit for the electricity cost in a fully renewable electricity supply.}

  abstract = {Globally, due to industrialization, GHG emissions continue to increase. This is despite the existing scientific and political consensus to fight human-induced climate change. To reverse this trend, viable, cost-effective decarbonization pathways are needed. We focus on the European power supply system and demonstrate the techno-economic feasibility of reaching the EU's mitigation targets by 2050. We show that a transition from conventional to renewable-based power supply systems is possible for the EU even with a politically driven nuclear power phase-out. We provide a guideline for European stakeholders that shows how to transform their power generation systems. By following our recommendations, the EU can be a role model for other countries and regions moving towards decarbonization. Our work is guided by two main motivations: {$\bullet$} How can the transition of Europe's power system be modeled adequately? {$\bullet$} What is the techno-economically optimal transition pathway for meeting the EU GHG power sector emission targets by 2050? A comparison of power system models has revealed a need for a combined short and long-term simulation tool that includes the principal power generation, storage and transmission technologies being considered in Europe. We adapted and applied the linear model elesplan-m to simulate a techno-economically optimized decarbonization pathway for 18 interconnected European regions and found that meeting the EU's reduction targets, i.e. reducing the GHG emissions from 1300 to 24~Mt CO2eq per year by 2050, can be achieved by large-scale capacity investment in renewable energy sources (RES). The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) would increase from 6.7 to 9.0 ctEUR/kWh and investments of 403 billion EUR would be necessary during the 34 year period analyzed. In 2050, the resulting power supply system is largely composed of wind power (1485~GW) and PV (909~GW), which are supported by 150~GW hydro power and 244~GW gas power. In addition, 432~GW of storage and 362~GW of transmission capacity are required to temporally and spatially distribute electricity. This work provides not only a feasible concept for a decarbonized power supply system, but shows also the implementation steps necessary to make the transition to that system cost-effective.}

Following this scientific consensus the European Union obliged it's member states to achieve high reduction targets to almost zero emissions -- especially in the power generation sector -- until 2050. Evidence-based strategies to implement cost-effective reduction pathways are necessary to achieve these targets. We developed a multi-regional power system model -- elesplan-m -- to analyze a least-cost decarbonization pathway for Europe with special focus on South-East-Europe (SEE). The analysis seeks for optimal strategies in the power sector while it neglects cross-sectoral demand shifts coming up with the electrification of transport and the use of heat pumps. Results underline both, the possibility and the enormous efforts required to achieve the intended decarbonization. SEE needs to increase its photovoltaic capacity to 120.7~GW, wind power capacity to 92.4~GW and transmission capacities to neighboring countries to 32.7~GW until 2050 to achieve the GHG emission reduction targets. The power system transformation requires annual average investments of almost one billion EUR in SEE. Resulting levelized cost of power supply of this region adds up to 12.1 ctEUR/kWh.}

  abstract = {Feasibility analysis for CSP projects requires quantifying the economic risk associated with the inter-annual variability of the solar resource and uncertainties in the annual energy production estimates. To assess this risk, statistical methods may be applied either before the system simulation (e.g. to create solar resource data in terms of exceedance probabilities such a P50 or P90) or on the system performance to determine the likelihood that a power plant will generate a certain amount of energy in any given year over the plant's life (e.g. the P50 or P90 annual productions). This paper presents and illustrates the long-term analysis of four CSP plants (parabolic trough and central receiver technology) in four sites within the Mediterranean and North Africa region; the analysis includes the exceedance probabilities estimations. Satellite-derived data for 20 years have been used for solar resource datasets in hourly basis, and multiyear simulations of the plant output have been performed with System Advisor Model. The associated uncertainties have been included in the long-term analysis of both DNI and CSP plant production. The results remark the advantages of multiyear analysis of CSP output for long-term analysis against the use of artificial meteorological years which represent the long-term.}

  abstract = {To limit the computational cost, bottom-up long-term (LT) energy-system planning models typically have a stylized temporal representation and do not consider techno-economic operational constraints of power plants. Both these simplifications have been shown to have a significant impact on the results. However, increasing the level of temporal and techno-economic operational detail will result in an increased computational cost. In this regard, the first goal of this work is to quantify which of these simplifications has the highest impact on the results, and should therefore be prioritized for improving. To do so, the impact of both the low level of temporal and techno-economic operational detail are quantified for a varying penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (IRES). For a high penetration of IRES, the gains obtained by improving the temporal representation are shown to outweigh the gains obtained by incorporating detailed techno-economic operational constraints. Therefore, improving the temporal representation is suggested to be prioritized. The second goal of this paper is to identify opportunities for model improvements. Different approaches to improve the temporal representation are proposed. While the focus in the literature lies primarily on the impact of the temporal resolution, this work more fundamentally considers and assesses different approaches of dealing with the temporal dimension. Using a different approach of defining the time slices to explicitly account for IRES variability is found to lead to a higher accuracy than can be obtained by simply increasing the temporal resolution, while requiring a lower number of time slices. Moreover, a temporal representation based on selecting a set of representative days can achieve an even higher accuracy, albeit requiring a higher number of time slices. An additional advantage of using representative days is that chronology is retained such that the impact of short-term dynamic fluctuations of IRES can be accounted for.},

The vast majority of the current approaches to select a representative set of days relies on either simple heuristics or clustering algorithms and comparison of different approaches is restricted to different clustering algorithms. This paper contributes by: i) proposing criteria and metrics for evaluating representativeness, ii) providing a novel optimization-based approach to select a representative set of days, and iii) evaluating and comparing the developed approach to multiple approaches available from the literature. The developed optimization-based approach is shown to achieve more accurate results than the approaches available from the literature. As a consequence, by applying this approach to select a representative set of days, the accuracy of ESOMs/GEPMs can be improved without increasing the computational cost. The main disadvantage is that the approach is computationally costly and requires an implementation effort.},

In this paper, we examine the post-Hurricane Maria rebuilding of Dominica's electricity system in light of recent scholarship around the Anthropocene and the Caribbean, work that has heightened awareness of the entanglements between the earth's geophysical forces and its socio-economic and geo-political relations. Drawing on archival research and key informants in Dominica, we describe the history of Dominica's energy system, and then provide an overview of some of the energy rebuilding efforts in the country's ongoing recovery from Hurricane Maria, particularly around the question of resilience. While we acknowledge critiques of resilience as a framework for disaster management, we also argue that resilience initiatives foster the potential for an Anthropocene reimagining of geosocial formations within the Caribbean. In the conclusion, we argue that the domain of energy, and in particular electricity, opens up important questions at the interface of social-ecological relations and the organization of collective life.}

  abstract = {The goal of this report is to help license applicants, resource agencies, and other members of the hydropower community involved in closed-loop pumped storage hydropower permitting and licensing process, focus the scope of environmental reviews, and more quickly identify impacts with project nexus and potential mitigation measures for these impacts. Pumped storage hydropower (PSH) is an energy storage technology that uses energy to pump water up from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir where water is stored until electricity is needed and the water is released to a lower reservoir passing through turbines. Closed-loop PSH---PSH that is not continuously connected to a naturally flowing water feature---is one of the lowest greenhouse gas emitting energy storage technologies and is therefore a critical part of the transition to renewable energy (Simon et al. 2023). Proposals for closed-loop PSH facilities in the United States currently account for more than 40\% of original licenses and 99\% of potential generation capacity in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) hydropower licensing pipeline (Johnson et al. 2023). While closed-loop PSH facilities can have lower environmental impacts than open-loop PSH facilities, no closed-loop facilities have been constructed in the United States to enable direct accounting of project impacts and efficacy of mitigations. Many proposals for closed-loop PSH submitted to FERC are abandoned early in the permitting and licensing process prior to license applications and environmental assessments, so there is little documentation describing potential project impacts and proposed mitigations. The newness of closed-loop PSH proposals in the United States may mean that tribal, federal, and state agencies with authorities for cultural and natural resources protection and management involved in the FERC licensing process may not have experience with closed-loop PSH regulation. Moreover, many proposed closed-loop PSH facilities are in areas that do not have high concentrations of conventional hydropower, so these agencies may also be unfamiliar with the FERC hydropower licensing process. The goal of this report is to help license applicants, resource agencies, and other members of the hydropower community focus the scope of environmental review for the closed-loop PSH development, licensing, and federal authorization process enabling quicker identification of potential impacts, mitigations, and situations where mitigation may not be possible. We found that environmental impacts of closed-loop PSH are highly site-specific, and generalizations about the types of environmental impacts across closed-loop PSH projects are difficult to make. Environmental impacts of closed-loop PSH are like those for open-loop PSH with a few exceptions including water sourcing, which can lead to delays and contention due to potential complexities with water rights, impacts to aquatic resources, and greenhouse gas emission potential. Cultural resource impacts were commonly reported in National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documents reviewed and discussed in interviews, but in many cases such impacts cannot be mitigated.},

  abstract = {For the last two decades, economic development in Reunion Island has led to major structural changes. The latter have been characterized by an increase in energy demand per person. This demand is mostly related to a high population growth (1.55\% per year). Reunion currently has 833,000 inhabitants. The population will rise to 1 million in 2030. Like most ultraperipheral regions of the European Union, Reunion is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels for its energy production. The total primary energy consumption amounted to 1352ktep in 2009 and 87.1\% is imported energy. The development of various renewable energies such as solar energy, biomass, ocean energy, etc. is thus of priority concern to aim to achieve energetic independence. Just like other French overseas territories, Reunion policies have widely invested in Renewable Energy Sources (RES) since 2000. This paper aims at presenting the current status, the major achievements of policies and the future objectives in the deployment of renewable energy programmes. The perspective of a net zero energy island versus the pressure of the population is analysed. The barriers to penetration of RES in a small-scale territory are also discussed.}

As pilot studies in the U.S. Army Net Zero program, 17 locations are moving to 100\% renewable energy, zero depletion of water resources, and/or zero waste to landfill by 2020. Some bases target net zero in a single area, such as water, whereas two bases, including Fort Carson, Colorado, target net zero in all three areas. We investigated sustainability strategies that appear when multiple areas (energy, water, and waste) are integrated. A system dynamics model is used to simulate urban metabolism through Fort Carson's energy, water, and waste systems. Integrated scenarios reduce environmental impact up to 46\% from the 2010 baseline, whereas single-dimension scenarios (energy-only, water-only, and waste-only) reduce impact, at most, 20\%. Energy conserving technologies offer mutual gains, reducing annual energy use 18\% and water use 15\%. Renewable energy sources present trade-offs: Concentrating solar power could supply 11\% of energy demand, but increase water demand 2\%. Waste to energy could supply 40\% of energy demand and reduce waste to landfill {$>$}80\%, but increase water demand between 1\% and 22\% depending on cooling system and waste tonnage. Outcomes depend on how the Fort Carson system is defined, because some components represent multiple net zero areas (food represents waste and energy), and some actions require embodied resources (energy generation potentially requires water and off-base feedstock). We suggest that integrating multiple net zero goals can lead to lower environmental impact for military bases.},

Two new types of ``generalized'' boundary conditions facilitate simulation of a wide range of hydrologic processes that interact with the groundwater model, such as rivers, drains, and evapotranspiration. For generalized-flow boundary conditions, gain (inflow) or loss (outflow) of fluid mass varies linearly with pressure, subject to optional upper and lower limits on flow and (or) pressure. For generalized-transport boundary conditions, gain or loss of solute mass or energy varies linearly with concentration or temperature, respectively. Two of the original types of SUTRA boundary conditions---specified-pressure and specified-concentration or temperature---have been modified such that user-specified, conductance-like factors (known as GNUP and GNUU in previous versions of SUTRA) are no longer required. The new lake capability works with all types of SUTRA boundary conditions, including the new generalized boundary conditions, to enable simulation of the interaction of groundwater flow and transport with lake water ``ponded'' on the surface of a three-dimensional model. SUTRA uses the topography of the top surface of the model, or, optionally, user-specified lake-bottom elevations, to identify potential lakes automatically. Increases and decreases in lake stage can cause lakes to coalesce and divide, respectively. The lake capability may be used with saturated or unsaturated flow and solute or energy transport.},

Energy system with high renewable share is examined by four scenarios differentiated by biomass potential and electric vehicle market share.

In renewable scenarios non-renewable energy sources are phased out by high tax for year 2050 and letting model find cost-optimal path from 2010 to 2050. Results indicate that high renewable share poses major changes in each energy system sector, especially in power generation, industry and transportation. Substantial biomass utilisation is required, and increased electrification of energy system, especially in industrial sector, is necessary with high penetration of solar and wind power. Solar photovoltaics (PV) reaches globally 39--44\% share in primary energy and 75\% share in electricity generation since positive development of PV technology directs especially power generation in Asia to solar power. This requires high capacity of power-to-x technologies, which use electricity to produce synthetic fuels used in industrial and transport sectors, and electricity storages. Transition to renewable energy system mitigates CO2 emissions by 90\% from 2010 to 2050, even though the issue of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions remain.}

Three scenarios are set with varying constraints for the energy system and with objective to improve conditions for wind and solar power seasoned with P2G utilisation. In BASE scenario, non-renewable energy sources are phased out by a high fuel tax for year 2050. In LO-HH2, the authors exclude hydrogen-based transport and reduce imported biofuels. In LO-BIO, they decrease availability of biomass for energy and advanced biofuel production. Reaching 100\% renewable target demands significant changes in energy system, especially in energy production and transport sectors. Transforming primary energy supply to renewable requires high level of electrification, but also bioenergy is essential for Finland and Sweden. Thus, P2G competes with biomass gasification technologies. Volatility of wind and solar power productions can be balanced by international trade. Main drivers for P2G are supply of synthetic gas to transport and industrial sectors, instead of acting as energy storage for surplus electricity.}

  abstract = {Customers who adopt solar panels can reduce their energy bills and lower the effective average electricity prices they pay. When the price falls, a solar consumer might consume more electricity than before -- a solar rebound effect. We provide the first empirical evidence of residential solar rebound effects in the U.S. We use household level hourly and daily electricity meter data as well as hourly solar panel electricity generation data from 277 solar homes and about 4000 non-solar homes from 2013 to 2017 in Phoenix Arizona. Using matching methods and a fixed effects panel regression approach, we find that when solar electricity generation increases by 1\,kWh, solar homes increase their total electricity consumption by 0.18\,kWh. This indicates that solar rebound effects are estimated at 18\%. Building upon our theoretical framework, the increase in consumer surplus from solar panel adoption is estimated at \$972/yr.}

  abstract = {Proposed large-scale electric generation and storage projects must apply for interconnection to the bulk power system via interconnection queues. While many projects that apply for interconnection are not subsequently built, data from these queues nonetheless provide a general indicator for mid-term trends in developer interest. Berkeley Lab compiled and analyzed data from all seven ISOs/RTOs in concert with 35 non-ISO utilities, representing an estimated 85\% of all U.S. electricity load. We include all "active" projects in these generation interconnection queues through the end of 2020, as well as data on "completed" and "withdrawn" projects for five of the ISOs (CAISO, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO, PJM). We find that the total capacity active in the queues is growing year-over-year, with over 750 GW of generation and an estimated 200 GW of storage capacity as of the end of 2020. Solar (462 GW) accounts for a large -- and growing -- share of generator capacity in the queues. Substantial wind (209 GW) capacity is also in development, 29\% of which is for offshore projects (61 GW). In total, about 680 GW of zero-carbon capacity is currently seeking transmission access, as is 74 GW of natural gas capacity. Hybrids now comprise a large -- and increasing -- share of proposed projects, particularly in CAISO and the non-ISO West. 159 GW of solar hybrids (primarily solar+battery) and 13 GW of wind hybrids are currently active in the queues. However, much of this proposed capacity will not ultimately be built. Among a subset of queues for which data are available, only 24\% of the projects seeking connection from 2000 to 2015 have subsequently been built. Completion percentages appear to be declining, and are even lower for wind and solar than other resources. Additionally, wait times are on the rise: in four ISOs, the typical duration from connection request to commercial operation increased from {\textasciitilde}1.9 years for projects built in 2000-2009 to {\textasciitilde}3.5 years for those built in 2010-2020. There are growing calls for queue reform to reduce cost, lead times, and speculation.},

Since diversity can be a factor in the long-term survival of a system, having a diversity of energy flows is frequently treated as a proxy for energy security. This paper examines the relationship between energy security and the diversity of an energy system's energy flows using a set of energy security indicators and the Shannon--Wiener diversity index. Although diversity may be considered necessary for maintaining and improving energy security, the quantitative analysis of the relationship shows that an energy flow considered diverse need not be secure and that a secure energy flow need not be considered diverse. Examples of this relationship are included. These findings can prove useful to policy makers and energy analysts when developing transition strategies for a jurisdiction's energy system.}

By applying a dispatch strategy that minimizes the balancing energy needs for a given storage size, the interplay between storage and balancing is quantified, providing a hard upper limit on their synergy. An efficient but relatively small storage reduces balancing energy needs significantly due to its influence on intra-day mismatches. Furthermore, we show that combined with a low-efficiency hydrogen storage and a level of balancing equal to what is today provided by storage lakes, it is sufficient to meet the European electricity demand in a fully renewable power system where the average power generation from combined wind and solar exceeds the demand by only a few percent.}

In this paper, we propose a framework based on quadratic programming by which the cost-benefit of energy time-shifting to a given customer may be evaluated. Accordingly, the consumer may justify expenditure on battery storage through either a least cost option of capital investment or choose to utilize existing electric vehicle (EV) battery storage, if available.}

It reveals a small number of important mismatch patterns, which explain most of the system's required backup and transmission infrastructure. Whereas the first principal component is already able to reproduce most of the temporal mismatch variability for a solar dominated system, a few more principal components are needed for a wind dominated system. Due to its monopole structure the first principal component causes most of the system's backup infrastructure. The next few principal components have a dipole structure and dominate the transmission infrastructure of the renewable electricity network.},

Our modeling framework features a high spatial and temporal resolution of electricity supply and demand, including renewable energy resources and generating technologies, while representing CO2 abatement options in non-electric sectors as well as economy-wide interactions. We find that clean and renewable energy standards entail substantial efficiency costs compared to a carbon pricing policy such as a cap-and-trade program or a carbon tax, and that these policies are regressive across the income distribution. The geographical distribution of cost is characterized by high burdens for regions that depend on non-qualifying generation fuels, primarily coal. Regions with abundant hydro power and wind resources, and a relatively clean generation mix in the absence of policy, are among the least impacted. An important shortcoming of energy standards vis-{\`a}-vis a carbon pricing policy is that no revenue is generated that can be used to alter unintended distributional consequences.}

  abstract = {Any pathway to a net-zero-carbon energy system in the United States will require a staggering build-out of infrastructure for electricity generation and transmission, zero-carbon fuels, and carbon sequestration. To date, however, there has been hardly any conversation among policy analysts, let alone high-level policymakers, about how such a massive infrastructure initiative should be undertaken. We have abundant evidence that our existing system for electricity infrastructure expansion is slow, inefficient, and expensive. In a spring 2021 workshop, the Niskanen Center and the Clean Air Task Force convened a group of practitioners, advocates, and academics to consider how the nation can achieve such an unprecedented infrastructure build-out, using electricity transmission as a case study. This paper summarizes some key themes and policy ideas from that workshop. A central framing concept is that policy for transmission infrastructure is traditionally structured around the three ``Ps'': planning, permitting, and paying. One important step forward would be to incorporate two additional Ps in policy design: participation (to include the perspectives and needs of the full range of stakeholders, especially local communities) and process (to provide a standard framework to spur project development and investment with clear expectations and accountability mechanisms). There was also broad support for the idea that a national transmission plan is needed to establish a clear set of goals and metrics across the many entities involved in moving electricity. From this foundation (3+2 ``Ps'' and a national plan) we describe a range of policy elements, then present two sample policy models for consideration, one emphasizing private enterprise and the other public initiative. While the objectives of the two sample initiatives are consistent, such as addressing conflicts in siting and permitting, they differ in the extent of federal authority that would be invoked. The problem of marshaling political support was beyond the scope of our discussion but must inform future development of the policy framework.},

Roughly speaking, they are a certain decomposition of a given space into cells, induced by a distance function and by a tuple of subsets called the generators or the sites. Voronoi diagrams have been the subject of extensive research during the last 35 years, and many algorithms for computing them have been published. However, these algorithms are for specific cases. They impose restrictions on either the space (often R2 or R3), the generators (distinct points, special shapes), the distance function (Euclidean or variations thereof) and more. Moreover, their implementation is not always simple and their success is not always guaranteed. We present an efficient and simple algorithm for computing Voronoi diagrams in general normed spaces, possibly infinite dimensional. We allow infinitely many generators of a general form. The algorithm computes each of the Voronoi cells independently of the others, and to any required precision. It can be generalized to other settings, such as manifolds, graphs and convex distance functions.}

They are typically computationally demanding, thus in need of simplification, where one such simplification is to reduce the temporal representation. This paper investigates how using representative periods to reduce the temporal representation in CEMs distorts results compared to a benchmark model of a full chronological year. The test model is a generic CEM applied to Europe. We test the performance of reduced models at penetration levels of wind and solar of 90\%. Three measures for accuracy are used: (i) system cost, (ii) total capacity mix and (iii) regional capacity. We find that: (i) the system cost is well represented ({\textbackslash}sim 5\% deviation from benchmark) with as few as ten representative days, (ii) the capacity mix is in general fairly well ({\textbackslash}sim 20\% deviation) represented with 50 or more representative days, and (iii) the regional capacity mix displays large deviations ({$>$} 50\%) from benchmark for as many as 250 representative days. We conclude that modelers should be aware of the error margins when presenting results on these three aspects.},

In this paper, we test whether the system cost further decreases when transmission is extended to intercontinental connections. We analyze a Eurasian interconnection between China, Mid-Asia and Europe, using a capacity expansion model with hourly time resolution. Our modelling results suggestthat a supergrid option decreases total system cost by a maximum of 5\%, compared to continental grid integration. The maximum cost reductionis achieved when (i) the generation is constrained to be made up almost entirely by renewables, (ii) the land available for VRE farms is relatively limited and the demand is relatively high and (iii) the cost for solar PV and storage is high. This is explained by that a super grid allows for harnessing of remote wind-, solar- and hydro resources demand centers. As for low-cost storage, it represents a competing variation management option, and may substitute part of the role of the supergrid, which is to manage variations through long-distance trade. We conclude that the benefits of a supergrid from a techno-economic perspective are in most cases negligible, or modest at best.},

The model is applied to Europe (EU-27~+~Norway and Switzerland), which the model divides into ten electricity balance regions and runs with 2920 time-steps The model is applied in a greenfield setting, in which the share of renewables (VRE~+~Hydro) varies between 0\% and 100\%. The results show that the system LCOE for VRE increases linearly with the penetration level range of 20\%--80\%, above which it increases sharply. Systems that have a high penetration of VRE are characterized by using wind power as the major generating technology and having strong expansion of transmission capacity. A sensitivity analysis for the cost of VRE and variation management capacity (storage and transmission) reveals that the point of increase in marginal LCOE is robust under different future scenarios regarding technology costs. We conclude that VRE could constitute the bulk of electricity generation at a reasonable cost, given that there is availability of variation management, especially with respect to transmission.}

The integral method predicts renewable capacities within a 10\% error margin, this paper's main performance metric, using just 32 time steps, while the representative days approach needs 160e200 time steps before providing similarly accurate renewable capacity estimates. Since the integral method generally cannot handle variation management, such as trade and storage, without enhancing the state-space representation, it may be more applicable to one-node models, while the representative days method is suitable for multi-regional models. In order to assess power systems with increasing renewable policy targets, models should be designed to handle at least the 160 time steps needed to provide results that do not systematically overestimate the renewable capacity share.},

  abstract = {The planning reserve margin is the predominant metric used in long-term planning models to ensure the resource adequacy of projected power systems. Considerable work has been done to estimate the contribution of variable renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar, to the planning reserve margin, but little work has been done to assess what planning reserve margin should be used in planning models. Typically, U.S.-based models use the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)-recommended reserve margin levels. However, historical reserve margins have often exceeded the NERC-recommended levels, suggesting that the use of NERC-recommended levels in planning models may negatively bias projected future capacity investments relative to real-world trends. Using the Regional Energy Deployment System capacity expansion model, we show that setting the planning reserve margin to observed levels in lieu of the NERC-recommended levels leads to substantial differences in near-term capacity additions. Scenarios using alternative specifications for the reserve margin resulted in increased national solar builds of 20--100\,GW. Given that the magnitude on results from altering the reserve margin level is similar to or greater than many policies frequently analyzed with planning models, careful consideration of the reserve margin level is crucial for developing accurate power sector projections.}

German utilities have largely failed to benefit from this development and lost 97\% of the distributed PV generation market to investors from outside the electric power industry. Recent studies indicate that utilities have to react to prevent revenue erosion and loss of profits. This study identifies threats and opportunities of distributed PV generation for utilities based on a series of interviews with German utility managers. The key finding is that utilities do not perceive distributed PV as a threat to their current business models nor do they see it as a potential market for them. Relating these findings to the existing literature on transformation processes in other industries leads to the conclusion that the solution for utilities lies in changing their perspective on distributed PV. Utilities could greatly benefit if they did not treat PV as just another source of electricity generation in competition with traditional sources (as they do today), but as a strategic gateway into the emerging distributed generation and service market. Distributed PV could function as a basis for further business model innovation in new growth markets such as energy efficiency and distributed storage. Specific recommendations are provided and a modular value proposition is suggested to help utilities to turn distributed PV from a threat into an attractive business opportunity.}

Although useful in an optimal policy context, a world-level approach obscures the heterogeneous geography of climate damage and vast differences in country-level contributions to the global SCC, as well as climate and socio-economic uncertainties, which are larger at the regional level. Here we estimate country-level contributions to the SCC using recent climate model projections, empirical climate-driven economic damage estimations and socio-economic projections. Central specifications show high global SCC values (median, US\$417 per tonne of CO2 (tCO2); 66\% confidence intervals, US\$177--805 per tCO2) and a country-level SCC that is unequally distributed. However, the relative ranking of countries is robust to different specifications: countries that incur large fractions of the global cost consistently include India, China, Saudi Arabia and the United States.},

The United States recently introduced an escalating production tax credit (PTC) to incentivize production of hydrogen meeting increasingly stringent embodied emissions thresholds. Hydrogen produced via electrolysis can qualify for the full subsidy under current federal accounting standards if the input electricity is generated by carbon-free resources, but may fail to do so if emitting resources are present in the generation mix. While use of behind-the-meter carbon-free electricity inputs can guarantee compliance with this standard, the PTC could also be structured to allow producers using grid-supplied electricity to qualify subject to certain clean energy procurement requirements. Herein we use electricity system capacity expansion modeling to quantitatively assess the impact of grid-connected electrolysis on the evolution of the power sector in the western United States through 2030 under multiple possible implementations of the clean hydrogen PTC. We find that subsidized grid-connected hydrogen production has the potential to induce additional emissions at effective rates worse than those of conventional, fossil-based hydrogen production pathways. Emissions can be minimized by requiring grid-based hydrogen producers to match 100\% of their electricity consumption on an hourly basis with physically deliverable, `additional' clean generation, which ensures effective emissions rates equivalent to electrolysis exclusively supplied by behind-the-meter carbon-free generation. While these requirements cannot eliminate indirect emissions caused by competition for limited clean resources, which we find to be a persistent result of large hydrogen production subsidies, they consistently outperform alternative approaches relying on relaxed time matching or marginal emissions accounting. Added hydrogen production costs from enforcing an hourly matching requirement rather than no requirements are less than \$1\,kg               -1               , and can be near zero if clean, firm electricity resources are available for procurement.},

When analysing 100\% renewable systems, the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources needs to be taken into consideration, so flexible solutions that can provide an option for regulating the energy system by balancing and storing excess electricity are essential. Coupled with the limitations of biomass resources and the need for the sustainable use of it, the solution that fits both concerns needs to be prioritized. The model analysed in this article is a 100\% renewable scenario of Denmark for 2050, where the data for the transport sector has been changed to estimate the fuel production costs for eight different fuel pathways. The results confirm that synthetic fuel pathways reduce the demand for biomass, while simultaneously increasing the flexibility of the energy system by enabling a high share of wind energy. The most interesting finding is that the production costs of synthetic fuels are comparable with petrol production costs once the associated CO2 emissions are included.}

An evolutionary program optimises the mix of technologies in 100\% renewable energy portfolios (RE) in the Australian National Electricity Market. Various technologies are reduced in availability to determine their relative importance for achieving low costs. The single most important factor is found to be the integration of large quantities of wind; therefore wind integration is identified as a research priority. In contrast, photovoltaics are found to ``saturate'' the system at less than 10\% of total energy (in the absence of storage or demand management, installation of further photovoltaics does not contribute significant further value). This indicates that policies to promote utility-scale photovoltaics should be considered in partnership with complementary measures (such as demand side participation and storage). Biofuelled gas turbines are found to be important; a complete absence of bioenergy increases costs by AU\$20--30/MWh, and even having only 0.1TWh per year of bioenergy available reduces average costs by AU\$3--4/MWh. Limits on the non-synchronous penetration (NSP) are found to be relatively expensive, suggesting a significant research priority around finding alternative approaches to providing synchronous services, such as inertia. Geothermal and concentrating solar thermal technologies do not appear essential as long as sufficient wind and peaking bioenergy is available.}

There are many proposed methods for accounting for the depletion of a particular resource, amongst which include the proportion of the resource depleted, the rate of resource depletion, and the energy, exergy, or monetary cost of extraction as the resource becomes harder to find or extract. This paper is part of a wider study to measure resource depletion using its environmental and economic impacts for the case of natural gas, where depletion of natural gas requires substitution by black coal or coal seam gas. The capital and operating costs are estimated both for upstream fuel extraction and purification and downstream use of the fuel to produce electricity, hydrogen and ammonia. These costs are based on a commercial scale of operation, using the same basis for economic modelling in each case. Black coal was found to have the lowest transfer price from upstream to downstream processing among the three feedstocks, but the highest capital and operating costs in the downstream processes. Conventional gas produced slightly higher transfer prices and downstream processing costs compared to coal seam gas. The favourable economic and environmental indicators for natural gas and coal seam gas are expected to lead to increased demand for these resources over coal, running the risk of a gas shortage. The economic consequence of a scarcity of either gas resource will be a penalty in capital and operating costs to produce the three products should gas be substituted with black coal.}

The purpose of this paper is to give an updated overview of currently available modelling tools, their capabilities and to serve as an aid for modellers in their process of identifying and choosing an appropriate model. A broad spectrum of modelling tools, ranging from small-scale power system analysis tools to global long-term energy models, has been assessed. Key information regarding the general logic, spatiotemporal resolution as well as the technological and economic features of the models is presented in three comprehensive tables. This information has been validated and updated by model developers or affiliated contact persons, and is state-of-the-art as of the submission date. With the available suite of modelling tools, most challenges of today's electricity system can be assessed. For a future with an increasing share of variable renewables and increasing electrification of the energy system, there are some challenges such as how to represent short-term variability in long-term studies, incorporate the effect of climate change and ensure openness and transparency in modelling studies.}

We show that the assumptions regarding turbine technology and land use policy are highly significant for the potential estimate. Modern turbines with lower specific ratings and greater hub heights improve the wind power potential considerably, even though it was assumed that the larger rotors decrease the installation density and increase the turbine investment costs. New technology also decreases the impact of strict land use policies. Uncertainty in estimating the cost of wind power technology limits the accuracy of assessing economic wind power potential.},

The overall cost-optimal design, based on standard cost assumptions, relies on synchronised backup across the transmission grid and comes with a renewable penetration of 50\% with a rather high wind fraction of 94\%. Given the current European electricity consumption, this corresponds to 600~GW rated wind power capacities, 60~GW installed solar power capacities, 320~GW conventional backup power capacity, and about five times today's installed transmission capacities. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the design and cost of the optimal system depend mostly on the assumed cost of wind capacity and fuel for backup energy. Lower costs for wind capacity, higher costs for backup energy and usage of otherwise curtailed excess electricity generation lead to a strong increase of the optimal renewable penetration. The sensitivity analysis is also used to find that a CO2 tax of over 100~{\texteuro}/ton would be needed for the economic viability of carbon capture and sequestration.}

  abstract = {The residual load and excess power generation of 30 European countries with a 100\% penetration of variable renewable energy sources are explored in order to quantify the benefit of power transmission between countries. Estimates are based on extensive weather data, which allows for modelling of hourly mismatches between the demand and renewable generation from wind and solar photovoltaics. For separated countries, balancing is required to cover around 24\% of the total annual electricity consumption. This number can be reduced down to 15\% once all countries are networked together with unconstrained interconnectors. The reduction represents the maximum possible benefit of transmission for the countries. The total Net Transfer Capacity of the unconstrained interconnectors is roughly 11.5 times larger than current values. However, constrained interconnector capacities 5.7 times larger than the current values are found to provide 98\% of the maximum possible benefit of transmission. This motivates a detailed investigation of several constrained transmission capacity layouts to determine the export and import capabilities of countries participating in a fully renewable European electricity system.}

  abstract = {Many impacts projected for a global warming level of 2 {$^\circ$}C relative to pre-industrial levels may exceed the coping capacities of particularly vulnerable countries. Therefore, many countries advocate limiting warming to below 1.5 {$^\circ$}C. Here we analyse integrated energy--economy--environment scenarios that keep warming to below 1.5 {$^\circ$}C by 2100. We find that in such scenarios, energy-system transformations are in many aspects similar to 2 {$^\circ$}C-consistent scenarios, but show a faster scale-up of mitigation action in most sectors, leading to observable differences in emission reductions in 2030 and 2050. The move from a 2 {$^\circ$}C- to a 1.5 {$^\circ$}C-consistent world will be achieved mainly through additional reductions of CO2. This implies an earlier transition to net zero carbon emissions worldwide, to be achieved between 2045 and 2060. Energy efficiency and stringent early reductions are key to retain a possibility for limiting warming to below 1.5 {$^\circ$}C by 2100. The window for achieving this goal is small and rapidly closing.},

  abstract = {A variety of mathematical models have been proposed to characterize and quantify the dependency of electricity supply technology costs on various drivers of technological change. The most prevalent model form, called a learning curve, or experience curve, is a log-linear equation relating the unit cost of a technology to its cumulative installed capacity or electricity generated. This one-factor model is also the most common method used to represent endogenous technical change in large-scale energy-economic models that inform energy planning and policy analysis. A characteristic parameter is the ``learning rate,'' defined as the fractional reduction in cost for each doubling of cumulative production or capacity. In this paper, a literature review of the learning rates reported for 11 power generation technologies employing an array of fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewable energy sources is presented. The review also includes multi-factor models proposed for some energy technologies, especially two-factor models relating cost to cumulative expenditures for research and development (R\&D) as well as the cumulative installed capacity or electricity production of a technology. For all technologies studied, we found substantial variability (as much as an order of magnitude) in reported learning rates across different studies. Such variability is not readily explained by systematic differences in the time intervals, geographic regions, choice of independent variable, or other parameters of each study. This uncertainty in learning rates, together with other limitations of current learning curve formulations, suggests the need for much more careful and systematic examination of the influence of how different factors and assumptions affect policy-relevant outcomes related to the future choice and cost of electricity supply and other energy technologies.}

With the goal of attaining non-missing, continuous, and physically plausible demand data to facilitate analysis, we developed a screening process to identify anomalous values. We then applied a Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) technique to impute replacements for missing and anomalous values. We conduct cross-validation on the MICE technique by marking subsets of plausible data as missing, and using the remaining data to predict this ``missing'' data. The mean absolute percentage error of imputed values is 3.5\% across all BAs. The cleaned data are published and available open access: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3690240.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In the context of 100\% renewable electricity systems, prolonged periods with persistently scarce supply from wind and solar resources have received increasing academic and political attention. This article explores how such scarcity periods relate to energy storage requirements. To this end, we contrast results from a time series analysis with those from a system cost optimization model, based on a German 100\% renewable case study using 35 years of hourly time series data. While our time series analysis supports previous findings that periods with persistently scarce supply last no longer than two weeks, we find that the maximum energy deficit occurs over a much longer period of nine weeks. This is because multiple scarce periods can closely follow each other. When considering storage losses and charging limitations, the period defining storage requirements extends over as much as 12 weeks. For this longer period, the cost-optimal storage needs to be large enough to supply 36 TWh of electricity, which is about three times larger than the energy deficit of the scarcest two weeks. Most of this storage is provided via hydrogen storage in salt caverns, of which the capacity is even larger due to electricity reconversion losses (55 TWh). Adding other sources of flexibility, for example with bioenergy, the duration of the period that defines storage requirements lengthens to more than one year. When optimizing system costs based on a single year rather than a multi-year time series, we find substantial inter-annual variation in the overall storage requirements, with the average year needing less than half as much storage as calculated for all 35 years together. We conclude that focusing on short-duration extreme events or single years can lead to an underestimation of storage requirements and costs of a 100\% renewable system.},

In particular, a small number of utilities have recently begun pursuing an ``if you can't beat `em, join `em'' sort of response to the rapid rise of rooftop solar.  This type of strategy is manifest in a handful newly-proposed projects that would essentially allow utilities to compete as producers in private rooftop solar markets.  What are the potential long-term consequences of allowing utilities to compete directly against rooftop solar energy companies?  And what sorts of considerations should inform policy decisions relating to this trend?  This article applies basic microeconomics framework that has long served as the primary theoretical basis for utility regulation itself to analyze new policies that permit regulated utilities to enter into distributed solar energy markets.  The article ultimately argues that regulated electric utilities should not be permitted to compete directly in markets for rooftop solar installations and that policies that actively guard against these ``unnatural monopoly'' problems will promote greater economic efficiency as innovation continues to transform electricity markets in the coming years.}

The existing field data on US power plant water use, however, is of limited granularity and poor quality, hampering efforts to track industry trends and project future scenarios. Furthermore, there is a need for a common quantitative framework on which to evaluate the potential of the many technologies that have been proposed to reduce water use at power plants. To address these deficiencies, we have created a system-level generic model (S-GEM) of water use at power plants that applies to fossil, nuclear, geothermal and solar thermal plants, using either steam or combined cycles. The S-GEM is a computationally inexpensive analytical model that approximately reflects the physics of the key processes involved and requires a small number of input parameters; the outputs are water withdrawal and consumption intensity in liters per kilowatt-hour. Data from multiple sources are combined to characterize value distributions of S-GEM input parameters across the US, resulting in refined estimates of water use with quantified uncertainties. These estimates are then validated against typical values from the literature and against an existing field data set. By adjusting S-GEM input values or value distributions, any number of hypothetical scenarios can be rapidly evaluated. As an example, we focus here on technology evaluation, expressing proposed technological improvements in terms of S-GEM input parameters, then comparing their projected effects on overall water withdrawal and consumption intensities.}

This paper summarizes some key conclusions from a set of economic analyses of N-R HESs.

  abstract = {This review critically examines hydrogen energy systems, highlighting their capacity to transform the global energy framework and mitigate climate change. Hydrogen showcases a high energy density of 120~MJ/kg, providing a robust alternative to fossil fuels. Adoption at scale could decrease global CO2 emissions by up to 830 million tonnes annually. Despite its potential, the expansion of hydrogen technology is curtailed by the inefficiency of current electrolysis methods and high production costs. Presently, electrolysis efficiencies range between 60~\% and 80~\%, with hydrogen production costs around \$5 per kilogram. Strategic advancements are necessary to reduce these costs below \$2 per kilogram and push efficiencies above 80~\%. Additionally, hydrogen storage poses its own challenges, requiring conditions of up to 700~bar or temperatures below -253~{$^\circ$}C. These storage conditions necessitate the development of advanced materials and infrastructure improvements. The findings of this study emphasize the need for comprehensive strategic planning and interdisciplinary efforts to maximize hydrogen's role as a sustainable energy source. Enhancing the economic viability and market integration of hydrogen will depend critically on overcoming these technological and infrastructural challenges, supported by robust regulatory frameworks. This comprehensive approach will ensure that hydrogen energy can significantly contribute to a sustainable and low-carbon future.}

Efforts have been made to assess the energy and cost required for the transition towards a sustainable energy supply covering the demand for power, desalination and industrial gas sectors. Hourly resolved model was used and optimization was carried out for each time period (transition is modeled in 5-year steps) on the basis of assumed costs and technological status till 2050 for all energy technologies involved. Solar PV dominates the installed technologies and contributes 92.7\% and 96.6\% in power and integrated scenarios. Seawater desalination sector dominates the integrated scenario and clean water demand is found to be 2.8{$\cdot$}1011 m3 by 2050. The levelised cost of electricity declines from 106.6\,{\texteuro}/MWh in 2015 to 46.2\,{\texteuro}/MWh in 2050 in power scenario. In country-wide scenario, gas storage rules from 2040 to 2050 in terms of total storage capacities while battery storage is prominent in terms of storage output. The results indicates that, 100\% renewable system is cost competitive and least cost option for Pakistan's future energy transition.}

The model is created in the EnergyPLAN software and is able to simulate all sectors of the national energy system on an hourly basis. The EnergyPLAN software and the main issues of its first Hungarian application are presented. The model is validated by comparing its results to Hungarian and international statistics for 2009. Two alternative models -- `Natural gas~+~biomass' and `Biomass' -- were created in EnergyPLAN for an analysis to see how the energy system of 2009 could have been operated in an optimised way from environmental point of view, within the existing infrastructure. In `Biomass' alternative model, the utilisation of primary renewable energy sources almost doubles, causing a decrease of 10\% in carbon-dioxide emission. By changing the distribution of fuels by a different power plant utilisation, more favourable fuel consumption characteristics could have been achieved from the environmental point of view in 2009.}

To conserve the valuable land \& water, installing Solar PV system on water bodies like oceans, lakes, lagoons, reservoir, irrigation ponds, waste water treatment plants, wineries, fish farms, dams and canals can be an attractive option. Floating type solar photovoltaic panels have numerous advantages compared to overland installed solar panels, including fewer obstacles to block sunlight, convenient, energy efficiency, higher power generation efficiency owing to its lower temperature underneath the panels. Additionally, the aquatic environment profits by the solar installation because the shading of the plant prevents excessive water evaporation, limits algae growth and potentially improving water quality.

  abstract = {Abstract             With increasing global interest in molecular hydrogen to replace fossil fuels, more attention is being paid to potential leakages of hydrogen into the atmosphere and its environmental consequences. Hydrogen is not directly a greenhouse gas, but its chemical reactions change the abundances of the greenhouse gases methane, ozone, and stratospheric water vapor, as well as aerosols. Here, we use a model ensemble of five global atmospheric chemistry models to estimate the 100-year time-horizon Global Warming Potential (GWP100) of hydrogen. We estimate a hydrogen GWP100 of 11.6\,{\textpm}\,2.8 (one standard deviation). The uncertainty range covers soil uptake, photochemical production of hydrogen, the lifetimes of hydrogen and methane, and the hydroxyl radical feedback on methane and hydrogen. The hydrogen-induced changes are robust across the different models. It will be important to keep hydrogen leakages at a minimum to accomplish the benefits of switching to a hydrogen economy.},

Previous research confirms that when energy storage systems are involved in the study, preserving the overall shape of the original data is crucial. This paper proposes a new time aggregation framework to incorporate a shape-based distance to jointly extract representative periods of wind and demand data. The duration curve of the net demand is used as a data-based validation index to compare the performance of the proposed method against other techniques. Also, a 3-bus case study that includes a wind resource, an energy storage system, and two conventional generators is designed. Four model-based validation indices are defined and applied for performance measurement, including the annual operation cost of the system, the annual wind curtailment in the system, the energy throughput of the storage facility, and the daily average of the state of the charge of the energy storage for each 365 days of the year.},

This evolution has been prompted by a broad set of factors, chief among them being: widespread adoption of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), increased customer investment in solar and other distributed energy resources (DERs), concerns about utilities' fixed cost recovery and revenue sufficiency in an era of flat or declining load growth, and significant changes to utilities' hourly net load profiles and operational needs as greater amounts of variable renewable energy (VRE) resources connect to the grid. This report discusses five current retail rate design trends among residential and commercial customer classes that have emerged, at least in part, in response to those drivers, and uses case studies to illustrate key motivations, variations in rate design, and aspects of implementation experience.}

We performed a scoping analysis using a financial model to quantify the financial impacts of customer-sited PV on utility shareholders and ratepayers and to assess the magnitude of these impacts under alternative utility conditions. We find that customer-sited PV generally reduces utility collected revenues greater than reductions in costs leading to a revenue erosion effect and lost future earnings opportunities. We also find that average retail rates increase as utility costs are spread over a relatively smaller sales base. We analyze these results under various assumptions about utility operating and regulatory environments and find that these impacts can vary greatly depending upon the specific circumstances of the utility. Based on this analysis, we highlight potential implications for policymakers and identify key issues warranting further analysis.}

Regulators are considering alternative regulatory and ratemaking approaches to mitigate these financial impacts. We performed a scoping analysis using a financial model to quantify the efficacy of mitigation approaches in reducing financial impacts of customer-sited PV on utility shareholders and ratepayers. We find that impacts can be mitigated through various incremental changes to utility regulatory and business models, though the efficacy varies considerably depending on design and particular utility circumstances.

Some end-of-century impacts were projected: {$\bullet$} Expected warming will decrease gas-fired generator efficiency. The maximum statewide coincident loss is projected at 10.3 gigawatts (with current power plant infrastructure and population), an increase of 6.2 percent over current temperature-induced losses. {$\bullet$} By the end of the century, electricity demand for almost all summer days is expected to exceed the current ninetieth percentile per-capita peak load. {$\bullet$} As much as 21 percent growth is expected in ninetieth percentile peak demand (percapita, exclusive of population growth). When generator losses are included in the demand, the ninetieth percentile peaks may increase up to 25 percent. {$\bullet$} As the climate warms, California's peak supply capacity will need to grow faster than the population. {$\bullet$} Substation capacity is projected to decrease an average of 2.7 percent. {$\bullet$} A 5ºC (9ºF) air temperature increase (the average increase predicted for hot days in August) will diminish the capacity of a fully-loaded transmission line by an average of 7.5 percent. {$\bullet$} The potential exposure of transmission lines to wildfire is expected to increase with time. We have identified some lines whose probability of exposure to fire are expected to increase by as much as 40 percent. {$\bullet$} Up to 25 coastal power plants and 86 substations are at risk of flooding (or partial flooding) due to sea level rise.},

  abstract = {Wind and solar energy will play an important role in the decarbonization of the European electricity generation. However, high shares of these variable renewable energies (VREs) challenge the power system considerably due to their temporal fluctuations and geographical dispersion. In this paper, we systematically analyze transmission grid extensions as an integration measure for VREs in Europe. We show the effects of grid extensions for fundamental properties of the power system as a function of the penetration and mix of wind and solar energy. Backup capacity requirements and overproduction are reduced with a powerful overlay transmission grid. We determine the costs of the grid extensions in dependence of the VRE penetration and mix and find that the grid integration costs remain below 25\% of the VRE investment costs for all conceivable VRE configurations. Furthermore, robust design features of future power systems in terms of grid geometry and flexibility requirements for backup technologies are identified. We apply a spatially and temporally highly resolved techno-economic model of the European power system for our analysis.}

  abstract = {High shares of intermittent renewable power generation in a European electricity system will require flexible backup power generation on the dominant diurnal, synoptic, and seasonal weather timescales. The same three timescales are already covered by today's dispatchable electricity generation facilities, which are able to follow the typical load variations on the intra-day, intra-week, and seasonal timescales. This work aims to quantify the changing demand for those three backup flexibility classes in emerging large-scale electricity systems, as they transform from low to high shares of variable renewable power generation. A weather-driven modelling is used, which aggregates eight years of wind and solar power generation data as well as load data over Germany and Europe, and splits the backup system required to cover the residual load into three flexibility classes distinguished by their respective maximum rates of change of power output. This modelling shows that the slowly flexible backup system is dominant at low renewable shares, but its optimized capacity decreases and drops close to zero once the average renewable power generation exceeds 50\% of the mean load. The medium flexible backup capacities increase for modest renewable shares, peak at around a 40\% renewable share, and then continuously decrease to almost zero once the average renewable power generation becomes larger than 100\% of the mean load. The dispatch capacity of the highly flexible backup system becomes dominant for renewable shares beyond 50\%, and reach their maximum around a 70\% renewable share. For renewable shares above 70\% the highly flexible backup capacity in Germany remains at its maximum, whereas it decreases again for Europe. This indicates that for highly renewable large-scale electricity systems the total required backup capacity can only be reduced if countries share their excess generation and backup power.}

We interpolate between two concepts for balancing the variability of these renewable sources: balancing at continental scales using the transmission grid and balancing locally with storage. This interpolation is done by systematically restricting transmission capacities from the optimum level to zero. We run techno-economic cost optimizations for the capacity investment and dispatch of wind, solar, hydroelectricity, natural gas power generation and transmission, as well as storage options such as pumped-hydro, battery, and hydrogen storage. The simulations assume a 95\% CO2 emission reduction compared to 1990, and are run over a full historical year of weather and electricity demand for 30 European countries. In the cost-optimal system with high levels of transmission expansion, energy generation is dominated by wind (65\%) and hydro (15\%), with average system costs comparable to today's system. Restricting transmission shifts the balance in favour of solar and storage, driving up costs by a third. As the restriction is relaxed, 85\% of the cost benefits of the optimal grid expansion can be captured already with only 44\% of the transmission volume.}

Here this influence is studied using a techno-economic optimisation model for a networked system of 30 European countries, taking into account the capacity investment and operation of wind, solar, hydroelectricity, natural gas power generation, transmission, and different storage options. A considerable robustness of total system costs to the input weather data and to moderate changes in the cost assumptions is observed. Flat directions in the optimisation landscape around cost-optimal configurations often allow system planners to choose between different technology options without a significant increase in total costs, for instance by replacing onshore with offshore wind power capacity in case of public acceptance issues. Exploring a range of carbon dioxide emission limits shows that for scenarios with moderate transmission expansion, a reduction of around 57\% compared to 1990 levels is already cost optimal. For stricter carbon dioxide limits, power generated from gas turbines is at first replaced by generation from increasing renewable capacities. Non-hydro storage capacities are only built for low-emission scenarios, in order to provide the necessary flexibility to meet peaks in the residual load.}

However, prior work has typically used present-day grid infrastructures to characterize the relationship between the duration and arbitrage value of storage in electricity markets. This study leverages established National Renewable Energy Laboratory grid planning and operations tools, analysis, and data to execute a price-taker model of an energy storage system for several 8760 h price series representative of current and future contiguous United States grid infrastructures with varying shares of variable renewable energy (VRE). We find that the total value of energy storage typically increases with VRE shares, but any increase in the relative value of longer storage durations over time depends on the region and grid mix. Some regions see incremental value increasing notably, up to 20--40 h in 2050, while others do not. The negative effect of lower roundtrip efficiency on value is also found to be scenario-dependent, with the energy value in higher VRE scenarios being less sensitive to roundtrip efficiency and more supportive of longer storage durations. Long-duration storage value and deployment potential are a function of evolving electricity sector infrastructure, markets, and policy, making it critical to consistently revisit potential long-duration storage contributions to the grid.},

The weather data is transformed into power, different aspects such as capacity factors and correlation lengths are investigated and the resulting implications for the European power system are discussed. In addition, we compare a 30-node model of Europe with historical and climate change-affected data, where investments in generation, transmission and storage facilities are optimised. Differences in capacity factors among European countries are more strongly emphasized at the end of the century compared to historic data. This results in a significantly increased photovoltaic share in the cost-optimal power system. In addition, annual hydro inflow patterns of major hydro producers change considerably. System costs increase by 5\% until the end of the century and the impact of climate change on these costs is of similar magnitude as differences between the ensemble members. The results show that including climate affected-weather data in power system simulations of the future has an observable effect.}

  abstract = {Summary The future role of stationary electricity storage is perceived as highly uncertain. One reason is that most studies into the future cost of storage technologies focus on investment cost. An appropriate cost assessment must be based on the application-specific lifetime cost of storing electricity. We determine the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for 9 technologies in 12 power system applications from 2015 to 2050 based on projected investment cost reductions and current performance parameters. We find that LCOS will reduce by one-third to one-half by 2030 and 2050, respectively, across the modeled applications, with lithium ion likely to become most cost efficient for nearly all stationary applications from 2030. Investments in alternative technologies may prove futile unless significant performance improvements can retain competitiveness with lithium ion. These insights increase transparency around the future competitiveness of electricity storage technologies and can help guide research, policy, and investment activities to ensure cost-efficient deployment.}

  abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are a new load type with considerable temporal flexibility. This work evaluates to what extent EV fleets (based on empirical driving profiles from two distinct sociodemographic groups) can cover their charging requirements by means of variable renewable generation (wind or solar-PV). For this purpose we formulate a mixed-integer optimization problem minimizing the amount of conventional generation employed. The results indicate that the usage of variable renewable generation can be more than doubled as compared to uncoordinated charging. Furthermore, we analyze how the utilization of renewable generation by EV fleets is affected through different portfolios of renewable generation sources, charging infrastructure specifications as well as a reduced optimization horizon.}

  abstract = {Decision makers rely on models to make important regulatory, policy, and investment decisions. For power systems, these models must capture (i) the future challenges introduced by the integration of large quantities of variable renewable energy sources and (ii) the role that energy storage technologies should play. In this paper, we explore several different approaches to selecting representative days for generation expansion planning models, focusing on capturing these dynamics. Further, we propose a new methodology for adjusting the outputs of clustering algorithms that provides three advantages: the targeted level of net demand is captured, the underlying net demand shapes that define ramping challenges are accurately represented, and the relationship between annual energy and peak demand is captured. This weighting methodology reduces the magnitude of the error in the representative day based generation expansion planning models estimation of costs by 61\% on average. The results also demonstrate the importance of carefully performing the clustering of representative days for both system costs and technology mix. In most cases improvements to the total cost of different representative day based expansion plans are realised where conventional generation capacity is substituted for energy storage. Based on the energy storage technology selected we conclude this capacity is being used to address ramping challenges as opposed to shifting renewable generation from off to on peak periods, reinforcing the importance of capturing detailed intraday dynamics in the representative day selection process.},

To limit its heavy dependence on imported fossil fuels, Reunion Island aims to achieve energy autonomy by 2030 based on greater energy efficiency and renewable energy alternatives. The objective of this study is to analyze different scenarios to reach electricity autonomy and, at the same time, consider the wide-scale integration of renewable energy in the island's power system using the bottom-up optimization energy model TIMES-Reunion. Despite the tremendous potential of renewable energy sources present on the island, the transition to 100\% renewable energy needs to be supported by incentives or constraints. Strong energy policies can both direct the choice of renewable resources and accelerate the renewable transition. The development of biomass on Reunion Island is economically interesting. The transition scenarios show that by 2030, electricity from biomass advantageously replaces electricity from coal and represents slightly more than 50\% of electricity generation. Solar and wave/ocean energies are not the most cost effective option, but wind energy tends to disappear in the face of these energies more politically supported. A network regulation rule benefits biomass and is more detrimental to solar than to wave energy. The decarbonized transition of the power system incurs higher total discounted system costs due to the additional costs induced by the different incentives to promote certain renewables, with some pathways toward energy autonomy appearing more costly than others.}

This paper briefly reviews the complete package of surface observations, models, and satellite data used for the latest version of the NSRDB as well as improvements in the measurement and modeling technologies deployed in the NSRDB over the years. The current NSRDB provides solar irradiance at a 4-km horizontal resolution for each 30-min interval from 1998 to 2016 computed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Physical Solar Model (PSM) and products from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), the National Ice Center's (NIC's) Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2). The NSRDB irradiance data have been validated and shown to agree with surface observations with mean percentage biases within 5\% and 10\% for global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct normal irradiance (DNI), respectively. The data can be freely accessed via https://nsrdb.nrel.gov or through an application programming interface (API). During the last 23 years, the NSRDB has been widely used by an ever-growing group of researchers and industry both directly and through tools such as NREL's System Advisor Model.},

  abstract = {Publicly accessible, high-quality, long-term, satellite-based solar resource data is foundational and critical to solar technologies to quantify system output predictions and deploy solar energy technologies in grid-tied systems. Solar radiation models have been in development for more than three decades. For many years, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) developed and/or updated such models through the National Solar Radiation Data Base (NSRDB). There are two widely used approaches to derive solar resource data from models: (a) an empirical approach that relates ground-based observations to satellite measurements and (b) a physics-based approach that considers the radiation received at the satellite and creates retrievals to estimate clouds and surface radiation. Although empirical methods have been traditionally used for computing surface radiation, the advent of faster computing has made operational physical models viable. The Physical Solar Model (PSM) developed by NREL in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) computes global horizontal irradiance (GHI) using the visible and infrared channel measurements from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) system. PSM uses a two-stage scheme that first retrieves cloud properties and then uses those properties to calculate surface radiation. The cloud properties in PSM are generated using the AVHRR Pathfinder Atmospheres-Extended (PATMOS-x) algorithms [5]. Using the cloud mask from PATMOS-x, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) and precipitable water vapor (PWV) from ancillary sources, the direct normal irradiance (DNI) and GHI are computed for clear-sky conditions using the MMAC model. For cloud scenes identified by the cloud mask, the Satellite Algorithm for Surface Radiation Budget (SASRAB) is used to compute the GHI. The DNI for cloud scenes is then computed using the DISC model [6]. The current NSRDB update has a 4-km x 4-km, 30-minute resolution covering 2005 2012. This paper evaluates the PSM-based NSRDB data set using ground-measured data and provides detailed evaluation statistics. The result of the comparison shows a good correlation between the NSRDB and ground data. Further, an outline of the next version of the NSRDB and future plans for enhancement and improvement are provided. This version is expected to be released in September 2015 and will contain data from 1998 2014.},

But even without valuing externalities, retail electricity prices typically exceed private marginal cost, due to a utility's need to cover average costs. Furthermore, due to costly storage, the marginal cost of electricity can fluctuate widely hour-to-hour, while retail prices do not. We show that residential electricity rates exceed average SMC in most of the US, but there is large variation, both geographically and temporally. This  nding has important implications for pass-through of pollution costs, as well as for policies to promote dynamic pricing, alternative energy and reduced electricity consumption.}

The upfront energy invested in constructing a RE infrastructure subtracts from the net energy available for societal energy needs, a fact typically neglected in energy projections. Modeling feasible energy transition pathways to provide different net energy levels we find that they are critically dependent on the fossil fuel emissions cap and phase-out profile and on the characteristic energy return on energy invested of the RE technologies. The easiest pathway requires installation of RE plants to accelerate from 0.12 TWp yr--1 in 2013 to peak between 7.3 and 11.6 TWp yr--1 in the late 2030s, for an early or a late fossil-fuel phase-out respectively in order for emissions to stay within the recommended CO2 budget.},

This paper will discuss the essence of the natural gas infrastructure for supplying the ever-increasing number of gas-powered units and use security-constrained unit commitment to analyze the short-time impact of natural gas prices on power generation scheduling. The paper analyzes the impact of natural gas infrastructure contingencies on the operation of electric power systems. Furthermore, the paper examines the impact of renewable sources of energy such as pumped-storage units and photovoltaic/battery systems on power system security by reducing the dependence of electricity infrastructure on the natural gas infrastructure.

  abstract = {Until recently, the relatively high levelized cost of electricity from solar photovoltaic (PV) technology limited deployment; however, recent cost reductions, combined with various financial incentives and innovative financing techniques, have made PV fully competitive with conventional sources in many American regions. In addition, the costs of electrical storage have also declined enough to make PV+battery systems potentially economically viable for a mass-scale off-grid low-emission transition. However, many regions in the U.S. (e.g. Northern areas) cannot have off-grid PV systems without prohibitively large battery systems. Small-scale combined heat and power (CHP) systems provide a potential solution for off-grid power backup of residential-scale PV+battery arrays, while also minimizing emissions from conventional sources. Thus, an opportunity is now available to maximize the use of solar energy and gain the improved efficiencies possible with CHPs to deploy PV+battery+CHP systems throughout the U.S. The aim of this study is to determine the technical viability of such systems by simulating PV+battery+CHP hybrid systems deployed in three representative regions in the U.S., using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) Pro Microgrid Analysis tool. The results show that the electricity generated by each component of the hybrid system can be coupled to fulfill the residential load demand. A sensitivity analysis of these hybrid off grid systems is carried out as a function capacity factor of both the PV and CHP units. The results show that conservatively sized systems are technically viable in any continental American climate and the details are discussed to provide guidance for both design and deployment of PV+battery+CHP hybrid systems to reduce consumer costs, while reducing energy- and electricity-related emissions.},

This paper extensively reviews the technical challenges, on particular, the stability issues associated with the integration of large-scale PV into the power system. In addition, the paper also reviews the dynamic model of large-scale PV for stability studies as well as the grid codes for large-scale PV integration into the system.

With regards to transmission lines, the allowable current of conductors is forecasted based on the environmental situations expected in some forthcoming time periods. Due to the fact that weather conditions continuously vary, sampling points are very limited against many line spans, and the measurements have an inherent error, uncertainties must be appropriately included in the DTR determination. This paper adopts the fuzzy theory as a strong and simple tool to model uncertainties in the DTR calculation. Since DTR intends to determine the line capacity for some periods ahead, the capability of fuzzy computation in predicting future phenomena is very fruitful here. In the proposed model, variables, such as ambient temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and solar hour angle are assumed to be fuzzy numbers. Numerical simulations are provided based on inputs taken from real databases and reasonable assumptions as well. The results obtained support the validation and efficiency of the proposed model.},

Assuming minimal excess generation, lossless transmission, and no other generation sources, the analysis indicates that wind-heavy or solar-heavy U.S.-scale power generation portfolios could in principle provide {$\sim$}80\% of recent total annual U.S. electricity demand. However, to reliably meet 100\% of total annual electricity demand, seasonal cycles and unpredictable weather events require several weeks' worth of energy storage and/or the installation of much more capacity of solar and wind power than is routinely necessary to meet peak demand. To obtain {$\sim$}80\% reliability, solar-heavy wind/solar generation mixes require sufficient energy storage to overcome the daily solar cycle, whereas wind-heavy wind/solar generation mixes require continental-scale transmission to exploit the geographic diversity of wind. Policy and planning aimed at providing a reliable electricity supply must therefore rigorously consider constraints associated with the geophysical variability of the solar and wind resource - even over continental scales.}

This detailed representation greatly increases the computational difficulty of obtaining optimal solutions, but is necessary to accurately model the location of new investment in generation. Given the proposed regulation of CO2 emissions from US power plants, an examination of economically efficient policies for reducing these emissions is warranted. The model incorporates realistic physical constraints, investment and retirement of generation, and price-responsive load to simulate the effects of policies for limiting CO2 emissions over a twenty-year forecast horizon. Using network reductions for each of the three electric system regions in the U.S. And Canada, an optimal economic dispatch, that satisfies reliability criteria, is assigned for 12 typical hour-types in each year. Three scenarios are modeled that consider subsidies for renewables and either CO2 emissions regulation on new investment or cap-and-trade. High and low gas price trends are also simulated and have large effects on prices of electricity but small impacts on CO2 emissions. Low gas prices with cap-and-trade reduce CO2 emissions the most, large subsidies for renewables alone do not reduce carbon emissions much below existing levels. Extensive retirement of coal-fired power plants occurs in all cases.}

  abstract = {Increased use of natural gas has been promoted as a means of decarbonizing the US power sector, because of superior generator efficiency and lower CO2 emissions per unit of electricity than coal. We model the effect of different gas supplies on the US power sector and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Across a range of climate policies, we find that abundant natural gas decreases use of both coal and renewable energy technologies in the future. Without a climate policy, overall electricity use also increases as the gas supply increases. With reduced deployment of lower-carbon renewable energies and increased electricity consumption, the effect of higher gas supplies on GHG emissions is small: cumulative emissions 2013--55 in our high gas supply scenario are 2\% less than in our low gas supply scenario, when there are no new climate policies and a methane leakage rate of 1.5\% is assumed. Assuming leakage rates of 0 or 3\% does not substantially alter this finding. In our results, only climate policies bring about a significant reduction in future CO2 emissions within the US electricity sector. Our results suggest that without strong limits on GHG emissions or policies that explicitly encourage renewable electricity, abundant natural gas may actually slow the process of decarbonization, primarily by delaying deployment of renewable energy technologies.},

The uncertain value of continued wind turbine and project growth limits the ability of the supply chain to prepare for future technology trends, leading to challenges in the realization of larger projects. This analysis explores the levelized cost of energy impacts of turbine ratings between 6 and 20 MW and plant capacities between 250 and 2,500 MW for fixed-bottom offshore wind using techno-economic cost models for foundation, electrical, installation, and operation and maintenance costs, along with annual energy production. We consider a nominal set of technology assumptions for all scenarios to isolate economies of size and scale without additional benefits from decreasing turbine capital costs, quantity discounts for larger projects, or optimized technology solutions. These results indicate that using a 20-MW wind turbine in a 2,500-MW power plant array can reduce the levelized cost of energy by over 23\% relative to the global average turbine and plant size installed in 2019; primarily because of reductions in the balance-of-system and operation and maintenance costs. We also identify improved installation vessels, optimized export systems, and novel operation and maintenance strategies as additional cost reduction opportunities. These results suggest that upsizing represents a significant cost reduction opportunity for offshore wind energy and will continue to be a main factor in shaping the future of the sector.}

On the basis of the available geographically dispersed data for the Western USA, we analyze to what extent the geographic diversity of these resources can offset their variability. We determine the best match to loads in the western portion of the USA that can be achieved with wind power and photovoltaics (PV) with no transmission limitations.Without storage and with no curtailment, wind and PV can meet up to 50\% of loads in Western USA. It is beneficial to build more wind than PV mostly because the wind contributes at night. When storage is available, the optimal mix has almost 75\% as much nominal PV capacity as wind, with the PV energy contribution being 32\% of the electricity produced from wind. With only 10 GW of storage (twice the pumped hydro storage capacity that already exists in the Western Electric Coordinating Council), up to 82\% of the load can be matched with wind and PV, while in the same time curtailing just 10\% of the renewable energy throughout the year.

Renewable energy, energy efficiency, and energy conservation are all commonly suggested solutions. Both supply- and demand-side interventions will displace energyand emissionsfrom conventional generators. Marginal emissions factors (MEFs) give a consistent metric for assessing the avoided emissions resulting from such interventions. This paper presents the first systematic calculation of MEFs for the U.S. electricity system. Using regressions of hourly generation and emissions data from 2006 through 2011, we estimate regional MEFs for CO2, NOx, and SO2, as well as the share of marginal generation from coal-, gas-, and oil-fired generators. Trends in MEFs with respect to system load, time of day, and month are explored. We compare marginal and average emissions factors (AEFs), finding that AEFs may grossly misestimate the avoided emissions resulting from an intervention. We find significant regional differences in the emissions benefits of avoiding one megawatt-hour of electricity: compared to the West, an equivalent energy efficiency measure in the Midwest is expected to avoid roughly 70\% more CO2, 12 times more SO2, and 3 times more NOx emissions.},

As solar energy plants require access to land and the electric grid, the recent uptick in solar energy infrastructure features interplay with local specificities. This article thus examines the uptake of solar energy in Portugal at both the national and local scales. The purpose is to contribute to a timely debate on critical renewabilities and to provide valuable insights for the future rollout of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity in Portugal. The study demonstrates that solar energy policy measures not only show some start-stop aspects of the utility-scale solar PV roll-out, but have also tended to favour large companies, rather than community or individual operators. Three case studies point to a range of public attitudes regarding solar PV roll-out and its underlying drivers that are locally influenced by land use and sociocultural contexts, apparently more so than by concerns of low-carbon energy transitions. A key point for future solar energy transitions is, therefore, that local communities' concerns should be understood and approached cross-sectorally. Furthermore, the intersection of energy transitions and justice must be considered from a multi-scalar, multi-sited and cross-sectoral perspective.}

Our paper analyses technological and structural options in terms of energy efficiency and renewable energies for a massive reduction of energy-related CO2 emissions in Latin America. Brazil and Mexico share similar growth prospects but differ significantly with respect to renewable energy potentials. We identify, how this leads to different transformation pathways. By applying an energy system balancing model we develop normative energy system transformation scenarios across the heating, power, and mobility sectors, including their potential interactions. The normative scenarios rely on three basic strategies for both countries: (1) strong exploitation of efficiency potentials; (2) tapping the renewable energy potentials; and (3) sector coupling and electrification of heat supply and transport. Despite economic growth, significant CO2 emission reductions could be achieved in Brazil from 440 Gt/a (2.2 t/cap) in 2012 to 0.4 Gt (2 kg/cap) in 2050 and in Mexico from 400 Gt/a (3.3 t/cap) to 80 Gt (0.5 t/cap). Our study shows the gap between existing policy and scenarios and our strategies, which provide an economically feasible way to comply with the Paris treaty targets.},

  abstract = {The various forms of solar energy -- solar heat, solar photovoltaic, solar thermal electricity, and solar fuels offer a clean, climate-friendly, very abundant and in-exhaustive energy resource to mankind. Solar power is the conversion of sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaic (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP). The research has been underway since very beginning for the development of an affordable, in-exhaustive and clean solar energy technology for longer term benefits. This paper, therefore, reviews the progress made in solar power generation research and development since its inception. Attempts are also made to highlight the current and future issues involved in the generation of quality and reliable solar power technology for future applications. A list of 121 research publications on the subject is also appended for a quick reference.}

We use an electric power system model to explicitly evaluate the change in generator dispatches resulting from PHEV deployment in the Texas grid, and apply fixed and non-parametric estimates of generator emissions rates, to estimate the resulting changes in generation emissions. We find that by using the flexibility of when vehicles may be charged, generator efficiency can be increased substantially. By changing generator dispatch, a PHEV fleet of LIP to 15\% of light-duty vehicles can actually decrease net generator NO, emissions during the ozone season, despite the additional charging load. By adding V2G services, such as spinning reserves and energy storage, CO(2), SO(2), and NO(x) emissions can be reduced even further.},

This paper summarizes capabilities that operational, planning, and resource-adequacy models that include energy storage should have and surveys gaps in extant models. Existing models that represent energy storage differ in fidelity of representing the balance of the power system and energy-storage applications. Modeling results are sensitive to these differences. The importance of capturing chronology can raise challenges in energy-storage modeling. Some models `decouple' individual operating periods from one another, allowing for natural decomposition and rendering the models relatively computationally tractable. Energy storage complicates such a modeling approach. Improving the representation of the balance of the system can have major effects in capturing energy-storage costs and benefits.}

Aging electricity generating infrastructure is set to affect capacity margins after 2015. These developments, coupled with the increased proportion of inflexible and variable generation technologies will impact on the security of electricity supply. Investment in low-carbon technologies is central to the UK meeting its energy policy objectives. The complexity of these challenges over the future development of the UK electricity generation sector has motivated this study which aims to develop a policy-informed optimal electricity generation scenario to assess the sector's transition to 2050. The study analyses the level of deployment of electricity generating technologies in line with the 80\% by 2050 emission target. This is achieved by using an excel-based ``Energy Optimisation Calculator'' which captures the interaction of various inputs to produce a least-cost generation mix. The key results focus on the least-cost electricity generation portfolio, emission intensity, and total investment required to assemble a sustainable electricity generation mix. A carbon neutral electricity sector is feasible if lowcarbon technologies are deployed on a large scale. This requires a robust policy framework that supports the development and deployment of mature and emerging technologies.},

  abstract = {Ensuring power system reliability under high penetrations of variable renewable energy is a critical task for system operators. In this study, we use a loss of load probability model to estimate the capacity credit of solar photovoltaics and energy storage under increasing penetrations of both technologies, in isolation and in tandem, to offer new understanding on their potential synergistic effects. Increasing penetrations of solar PV alter the net load profile on the grid, shifting the peak net load to hours with little or no solar generation and leading to diminishing capacity credits for each additional increment of solar. However, the presence of solar PV decreases the duration of daily peak demands, thereby allowing energy-limited storage capacity to dispatch electricity during peak demand hours. Thus, solar PV and storage exhibit a symbiotic relationship when used in tandem. We find that solar PV and storage used together make a more significant contribution to system reliability: as much as 40\% more of the combined capacity can be counted on during peak demand hours compared to scenarios where the two technologies are deployed separately. Our test case demonstrates the important distinction between winter and summer peaking systems, leading to significantly different seasonal capacity values for solar PV. These findings are timely as utilities replace their aging peaking plants and are taking energy storage into consideration as part of a low carbon pathway.}

The U.S. Geological Survey has produced spatially explicit, thematically detailed LULC projections for the conterminous United States. Four qualitative and quantitative scenarios of LULC change were developed, with characteristics consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES). The four quantified scenarios (A1B, A2, B1, and B2) served as input to the forecasting scenarios of land-use change (FORE-SCE) model. Four spatially explicit data sets consistent with scenario storylines were produced for the conterminous United States, with annual LULC maps from 1992 through 2100. The future projections are characterized by a loss of natural land covers in most scenarios, with corresponding expansion of anthropogenic land uses. Along with the loss of natural land covers, remaining natural land covers experience increased fragmentation under most scenarios, with only the B2 scenario remaining relatively stable in both the proportion of remaining natural land covers and basic fragmentation measures. Forest stand age was also modeled. By 2100, scenarios and ecoregions with heavy forest cutting had relatively lower mean stand ages compared to those with less forest cutting. Stand ages differed substantially between unprotected and protected forest lands, as well as between different forest classes. The modeled data were compared to the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and other data sources to assess model characteristics. The consistent, spatially explicit, and thematically detailed LULC projections and the associated forest stand-age data layers have been used to analyze LULC impacts on carbon and greenhouse gas fluxes, biodiversity, climate and weather variability, hydrologic change, and other ecological processes.},

The study was performed using one-year hourly demand data of California's electricity grid together with the hourly-simulated output of various solar and wind technologies distributed throughout the state. The result shows that wind--solar complementarities carry significant multidimensional benefits to the future grid as compared to a stand-alone wind/solar based grid. Specifically at 20\% total energy loss, it was shown that their optimal complementarities lead to very high renewable penetration with smaller storage and backup requirement. Our study of system dispatch shows that storage provides flexible dispatch strategy, which makes it applicable for various services depending on season of the year including reduction of summer backup capacity need. We have also found that the existing peak load based long term planning reserve criteria may no longer be applicable to very high renewable grid. Finally, comparing our result to literature data, we conclude that some of the pessimistic views of storage technology are borne out of our lack of understanding about its role and design requirement.}

We examined how we could achieve very high-energy penetration from intermittent renewable system into the electricity grid. This study shows that the maximum threshold for the storage need is significantly less than the daily average demand. In the present study, we found that the approximate network energy storage is of the order of 186 GW h/22 GW (approximately 22\% of the average daily demands of California). Allowing energy dumping was shown to increase storage use, and by that way, increases grid penetration and reduces the required backup conventional capacity requirements. Using the 186 GW h/22 GW storage and at 20\% total energy loss, grid penetration was increased to approximately 85\% of the annual demand of the year while also reducing the conventional backup capacity requirement to 35 GW. This capacity was sufficient to supply the year round hourly demand, including 59 GW peak demand, plus a distribution loss of about 5.3\%. We conclude that designing an efficient and least cost grid may require the capability to capture diverse physical and operational policy scenarios of the future grid.}

The study uses Israel's electricity sector dataset, which has important characteristics typical for several Sun Belt countries. It has 7 scenarios aimed at assessing the impacts of various policy factors, such as carbon cost and coupling to the water sector. Under the present renewable electricity technology cost projections, a carbon cost only speeds up the transitions into renewable electricity. However, a No Carbon Cost scenario also achieves comparable results by 2050 (with only 2\% fossil). The levelized cost of electricity in 2050 was shown to be less than that of 2015 in all scenarios except under the Current Policy. The Current Policy scenario will significantly increase the cost of electricity in the post-2020 period even when a carbon cost is ignored. The observed emission reduction comes after 2030 but there are still significant emissions by 2050. This shows that Israel's present energy policy carries multiple risks to the nation. Alternatively, Sun Belt countries, such as Israel, can speed the transition of the electricity sector without the need to implement carbon cost, only by promoting solar photovoltaics and supporting batteries.}

Temporal simulation of the demand--supply matching is carried out for various system configurations. The role of hydrogen technologies for energy storage and fuel cell applications is studied and applied to both stationary energy use and transportation sectors. As an alternative, biofuels may take the role of hydrogen both as a storable fuel and for direct use in the transportation sector. It is shown that there is scope for considerable amounts of energy trade between the countries, due to the different endowments of different countries with particular renewable energy sources, and to the particular benefit that intermittent energy sources, such as wind and solar, can derive from exchange of power. The establishment of a smoothly functioning renewable energy supply system is demonstrated with the use of the seasonal reservoir-based hydrocomponents in the northern parts of the region. The outcome of the competition between biofuels and hydrogen in the transportation sector is dependent on the development of viable fuel cells and on efficient technologies for converting biomass residues to fuels.

  abstract = {The European energy policy is substantially driven by the target to reduce the CO2-emissions significantly and to mitigate climate change. Nevertheless European power generation is still widely based on fossil fuels. The carbon capture and storage technology (CCS) could be part of an approach to achieve ambitious CO2 reduction targets without large scale transformations of the existing energy system. In this context the paper investigates on how far the CCS-technology could play a role in the European and most notably in the German electricity generation sector. To account for all the interdependencies with the European neighboring countries, the embedding of the German electricity system is modeled using a stochastic European electricity market model (E2M2s). After modeling the European side constraints, the German electricity system is considered in detail with the stochastic German Electricity market model (GEM2s). The focus is thereby on the location of CCS plant sites, the structure of the CO2-pipeline network and the regional distribution of storage sites. Results for three different European energy market scenarios are presented up to the year 2050. Additionally, the use of CCS with use of onshore and offshore sites is investigated.}

  abstract = {The wide scale deployment of variable renewable energy technologies (VREs) offers a pathway to decarbonize the electric grid. One challenge to reliably operating the grid is ensuring that sufficient generating capacity is available to meet demand at all hours. By determining an individual generator's contribution to resource adequacy based on its expected availability when power is needed, the capacity credit for these resources is estimated. The objective of this study is to quantify the contribution of VRE to resource adequacy as a function of VRE penetration, across several regions, technologies, and resources. A computational model was built using the effective load carrying capability (ELCC) method to calculate capacity credit values for regions spanning the contiguous United States. As the deployment of VRE increases, we show its marginal contribution to meeting peak load decreases, which in turn requires additional generating capacity to maintain reliability. In addition, a rapid approximation method is demonstrated to estimate solar and wind capacity credit, relying on the capacity factors during hours of peak net demand. We find that estimates with the lowest error relative to capacity credits calculated using the ELCC method occur using the average renewable resource capacity factors of the top net 10 demand hours, regardless of resource type. Using context-specific values for capacity credit can improve long-term decision making in generation capacity expansion, cultivating more economical long-term resource planning for deep decarbonization.}

This holds even if wind and sun produce on average 100\% of the required energy. Backup generation can be reduced through storage -- averaging in time -- and/or grid extensions -- averaging in space. This report examines the interplay of these technologies with respect to the reduction of required backup energy. We systematically explore a wide parameter space of combinations of both technologies. Our simple, yet informative approach quantifies the backup energy demand for each scenario. We also estimate the resulting total system costs which allow us to discuss cost-optimal system designs.}

While battery storage remains a small portion of the grid, the pace of adoption has accelerated due to declining prices and the industry educating itself on the benefits of this technology. Many industry supporters see battery energy storage coupled with solar photovoltaic (PV) plants as a resource not only for dispatchable energy during evening and nighttime periods but also for deferring or replacing the need for conventional peaking generation for reliability. Given the variable nature of solar PV plants and the energy limits of battery energy storage, the ability to provide firm capacity for reliability is reduced. Additionally, the capacity value of these resources saturates at high penetrations, requiring a significant amount of solar and storage to replace conventional peaking capacity.}

The power system has always been heavily influenced by the weather---extreme temperatures determine the timing of peak demand, winter cold snaps can limit natural gas supply, gas turbine reliability and output are affected by ambient conditions, and hydro output varies seasonally and annually. However, as the grid increasingly relies on variable renewable energy (VRE), like wind and solar, the attention to reliability and weather conditions is increasingly important. The implications of changing reliability are large.

However, state-of-the-art long-term global climate simulations are unable to resolve the spatiotemporal characteristics necessary for resource assessment or operational planning. We introduce an adversarial deep learning approach to super resolve wind velocity and solar irradiance outputs from global climate models to scales sufficient for renewable energy resource assessment. Using adversarial training to improve the physical and perceptual performance of our networks, we demonstrate up to a 50{\texttimes}50{\texttimes}{$<$}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{$><$}mml:mn{$>$}50{$<$}/mml:mn{$><$}mml:mo{$>\times<$}/mml:mo{$><$}/mml:math{$>$} resolution enhancement of wind and solar data. In validation studies, the inferred fields are robust to input noise, possess the correct small-scale properties of atmospheric turbulent flow and solar irradiance, and retain consistency at large scales with coarse data. An additional advantage of our fully convolutional architecture is that it allows for training on small domains and evaluation on arbitrarily-sized inputs, including global scale. We conclude with a super-resolution study of renewable energy resources based on climate scenario data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report.},

This paper provides a unifying reference for defining the metric as it relates to modern analyses, while clarifying a number of common points of confusion in its application. In particular, the paper clarifies that LOLE is not a measure of expected total shortfall duration, that a 2.4 hours per year LOLE target implies a less reliable system than a 1 day in 10 years (0.1 days per year) LOLE target, and that exact conversions between hourly and daily LOLE targets are not generally possible.

Each case study traces the enactment and later revision of the policy, typically over a period of twenty-five years. We use these eight longitudinal case studies to identify common patterns in the politics of US renewable energy policy. Although electricity and transportation involve different actors and technologies, we find similar patterns across these sectors: immature technology is underestimated or misunderstood; large energy bills provide windows of opportunity for enactment; once enacted, policies are extended incrementally; there is increasing politicization as mature technology threatens incumbents.}

  abstract = {No one seriously questions that an improved and decarbonized energy supply system is a key component of climate change mitigation, but the United States' system of federalism complicates the siting of utility-scale renewable energy facilities. The new Biden Administration presents the United States with an opportunity to reimagine how this country regulates renewable energy siting, allowing for substantial national progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, primary siting authority for renewable energy projects rests with state and local governments, which generally exercise that authority through zoning and land use planning, while the federal government approves most interstate energy delivery systems. This fragmented system of governance can delay and even deter project development, simultaneously thwarting the optimal logic in developing a national renewable energy generation system. Proactive renewable energy project planning offers one potentially effective -- and constitutional -- solution to this renewable energy federalism dilemma, particularly in conjunction with negotiated siting guidelines and a centralized siting agency. Drawing upon the substantial body of scholarly work that advocates for federal or regional collaboration in renewable energy policymaking and for more balanced and dynamic federalism in the energy sector, this Article further advances those goals while also shifting the focal axis and underscoring renewable energy as the locus for expanding energy federalism and mitigating climate change.},

Appropriately modeling these resources, however, is difficult because of the wide variety of constraints these plants face that other generators do not. These constraints can be broadly categorized as environmental, operational, and regulatory. This report highlights several key issues involving incorporating these constraints when modeling hydropower operations in terms of production cost and capacity expansion. Many of these challenges involve a lack of data to adequately represent the constraints or issues of model complexity and run time. We present several potential methods for improving the accuracy of hydropower representation in these models to allow for a better understanding of hydropower's capabilities.},

  abstract = {After solar and other renewable energy developers select generally suitable sites for exploration, they frequently encounter conflict over biodiversity conservation values that were not factored into the initial suitability rating methods. This paper presents a spatial multicriteria analysis method for modeling risk of conflict with biological resources and applies the model in the California deserts where such conflicts are rapidly rising. The premise of the model is that the least conflict will occur on sites that are the most ecologically degraded with low conservation value and that would engender low off-site impacts when connecting to existing transmission infrastructure. Model results suggest sufficient compatible land exists in flat, non-urban areas to meet state solar energy targets of 8.7~GW of installed capacity in the California deserts for 2040. The model is a promising tool to fill the gap between site suitability analysis for renewable energy and regional biodiversity conservation planning to identify areas where rapid impact assessment and permitting will generate the least regrets.},

However, most climate benefit calculations do not adequately account for all climate warming emissions and impacts over time. This study reanalyzes a previously published life cycle assessment as an illustrative example to show how the climate impacts of hydrogen deployment can be far greater than expected when including the warming effects of hydrogen emissions, observed methane emission intensities, and near-term time scales; this reduces the perceived climate benefits upon replacement of fossil fuel technologies. For example, for blue (natural gas with carbon capture) hydrogen pathways, the inclusion of upper-end hydrogen and methane emissions can yield an increase in warming in the near term by up to 50\%, whereas lower-end emissions decrease warming impacts by at least 70\%. For green (renewable-based electrolysis) hydrogen pathways, upper-end hydrogen emissions can reduce climate benefits in the near term by up to 25\%. We also consider renewable electricity availability for green hydrogen and show that if it is not additional to what is needed to decarbonize the electric grid, there may be more warming than that seen with fossil fuel alternatives over all time scales. Assessments of hydrogen's climate impacts should include the aforementioned factors if hydrogen is to be an effective decarbonization tool.},

  abstract = {Power system investment planning problems become intractable due to the vast variability that characterizes system operation and the increasing complexity of the optimization model to capture the characteristics of renewable energy sources. In this context, making optimal investment decisions by considering every operating period is unrealistic and inefficient. The conventional solution to address this computational issue is to select a limited number of representative operating periods by clustering the input demand-generation patterns while preserving the key statistical features of the original population. However, for an investment model that contains highly complex non-linear relationship between input data and optimal investment decisions, selecting representative periods by relying on only input data becomes inefficient. This paper proposes a novel investment costoriented representative day selection framework for large scale multi-spacial investment problems, which performs clustering directly based on the investment decisions for each generation technology at each location associated with each individual day. Additionally, dimensionality reduction is performed to ensure that the proposed method is feasible for large-scale power systems and high-resolution input data. The superior performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through a series of case studies with different levels of modeling complexity.},

  abstract = {By its nature, electrification enhances the coupling between the electric sector and end-use sectors. Assessing the impacts of electrification requires both an examination of the complex interactions between sectors and a broader assessment of multiple parts of the energy system. The Electrification Futures Study (EFS) uses several complementary modeling and analysis tools to analyze the impacts of electrification on the U.S. energy system. In particular, the EFS relies on an overarching scenario analysis approach, but through the use of separate modeling approaches designed to assess various electricity demand- and supply-side futures. The primary model employed to generate the supply-side scenarios is the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) model, which is a capacity expansion model for the U.S. electricity system through 2050. Traditionally, the model has been primarily exercised in scenario analysis that implicitly assumed limited electrification. Because of this assumption, resulting future load profiles are approximated by historical ones, load growth is driven primarily by population and economic growth only, and changes in direct end-use natural gas consumption do not effect natural gas costs for electricity generation. In this report, we (1) reflect the potential for resource sharing between regions given these changes in demand, (2) represent how changes in natural gas consumption in end-use sectors could impact the economics of natural gas-fired generation, and (3) document a new model representation of demand-side flexibility used for the EFS. These improvements to ReEDS are employed for the EFS supply-wide analysis, which is summarized in a companion EFS report titled Electrification Futures Study: Scenarios of Power System Evolution and Infrastructure Development for the United States (Murphy et al. 2019).}

  abstract = {Transmission Network Expansion Planning (TNEP) in modern electricity systems is carried out on a costbenefit analysis basis; the planner identifies investments that maximize the social welfare. As the integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) increases, there is a real challenge to accurately capture the vast variability that characterizes system operation within a planning problem. Conventional approaches that rely on a large number of scenarios for representing the variability of operating points can quickly lead to computational issues. An alternative approach that is becoming increasingly necessary is to select representative scenarios from the original population via clustering techniques. However, direct clustering of operating points in the input domain may not capture characteristics which are important for investment decision-making. This paper presents a novel objective-based scenario selection framework for TNEP to obtain optimal investment decisions with a significantly reduced number of operating states. Different clustering frameworks, clustering variable s and clustering techniques are compared to determine the most appropriate approach. The superior performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a case study on a modified IEEE 118-bus system.},

Using multi-level qualitative analysis, we have identified seven key sources of opposition. Of the projects we studied, 34\% faced significant delays and difficulties securing permits, 49\% were cancelled permanently, and 26\% resumed after being stopped for several months or years. Project delays and cancellations account for potential lost generating capacity of almost 4600~MW.

  abstract = {A key selling point for the restructuring of electricity markets was the promise of lower prices. There is not much consensus in earlier studies on the effects of electricity deregulation in the U.S., particularly for residential customers. Part of the reason for not finding a consistent link with deregulation and lower prices was that the removal of transitional price caps led to higher prices. In addition, the timing of the removal of price caps coincided with rising fuel prices, which were passed on to consumers in a competitive market. Using a dynamic panel model, we analyze the effect of participation rates, fuel costs, market size, a rate cap and switch to competition for 16 states and the District of Columbia. We find that an increase in participation rates, price controls, a larger market, and high shares of hydro in electricity generation lower retail prices, while increases in natural gas and coal prices increase rates. We also find that retail competition makes the market more efficient by lowering the markup of retail prices over wholesale costs. The effects of a competitive retail electricity market are mixed across states, but generally appear to lower prices in states with high participation rates. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.}

Often, these utility-scale projects incite opposition from local communities -- once branded a ``Not in my backyard'' reaction. Here we conduct a cross-disciplinary review covering two interrelated topics: 1) solar siting analyses utilizing a geographical information system -- multicriteria decision analysis (GIS-MCDA) approach and 2) social science research discussing public responses to solar photovoltaic development. We follow this with a discussion on how to improve GIS-MCDA by more explicitly including aspects of the people and the place under study. Past research leans primarily upon technical and economic criteria directly related to the solar facility itself, largely ignoring social considerations, which are important for public acceptability and fairness. Incorporating siting criteria reflecting the interests of local people and how they interact with their immediate environment would not only improve the process for developers, but it could also be adapted to mitigate inequalities pervasive in the historical siting of energy facilities.}

This system has steadily increased the share of renewables, reaching a penetration level of over 30\%. The predictions made by ENTSO-e suggest that this level will increase to 50\% by 2030. Therefore, different scenarios are studied in this paper to investigate the evolution of renewable integration and assess the corresponding contributions to reliability. The assessment is performed using a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method considering the seasonality of renewable generation and the uncertainties related to renewable sources, failure issues and the maintenance of thermal-based units. The baseline for SMC is provided by historical annual time series of irradiance and wind power data from the Spanish system. In the solar case, these time series are transformed into power time series with models of CSP and PV generation. The former includes different thermal storage strategies. For wind generation, a moving block bootstrap (MBB) technique is used to generate new wind power time series. The CC is assessed based on the equivalent firm capacity (EFC) using standard reliability metrics, namely, the loss of load expectation (LOLE). The results highlight the low contribution of renewables to power system adequacy when the Spanish power system has a high share of renewable generation. In addition, the results are compared with those of similar studies.}

However, simple costs metrics such as levelized cost of electricity are poor indicators of the full system cost and the competiveness of different technologies.

This study compares different approaches for developing a 100\% renewable electricity system on the basis of the material mass investment required to sustain their physical components. Electric grid modeling accounting for operational constraints is used to determine the scale of energy technology capacities required to achieve a 100\% renewable electricity system using California as a representative example and translating those requirements to material mass requirements. Using a wind/solar/storage approach requires exponentially growing capacities of energy storage to meet operational needs and requires significant material mass investments. Material resource efficiency of the system is shown to be improved by maximizing the use of regional non-variable renewables to the extent possible within local capacity constraints. Alternatively, overbuilding the wind and solar capacity in excess of that needed to meet annual demand is also shown to improve material resource efficiency of the system. Overall, different approaches for meeting a 100\% renewable electricity penetration are not equally desirable when material resource usage is considered. This should be taken into account in future energy system planning studies.}

  abstract = {Traditional transmission line ratings are limited by a set of fixed conservative weather assumptions that are also known as static thermal rating (STR). Owing to STR, new line corridors are continuously required to address increasing electricity demands while minimizing the curtailment of renewable energy sources (RES). However, the expansion of an electricity network is expansive, long, and limited due to the scarcity in land and space. To overcome this issue, researchers have proposed a dynamic thermal rating (DTR) system that can increase the capacity of existing transmission lines. Research has shown that actual line ratings are higher than STR most of the time. The potential of using the DTR system to increase the reliability of power systems is therefore significant. Almost every country has begun the process of increasing the integration of RES, and consequently, the DTR system has become increasingly important. Exploring and reviewing critical studies on the DTR system are thus beneficial for researchers who are interested in the developments of DTR technology. This review paper begins by comparing the two main DTR system standards. Then, monitoring technologies of the DTR system are reviewed. Notable research on the reliability impacts of the DTR system on electrical networks are surveyed. Interactions with wind power and other smart grid technologies are also examined, and the concept of power system reliability is briefly discussed.},

In this work, we introduce a framework for using clustering methods for this purpose, and we compare both conventionally-used methods (kmeans, k-medoids, and hierarchical clustering), and shape-based clustering methods (dynamic time warping barycenter averaging and k-shape). We compare these methods in the domain of the objective function of two example operational optimization problems: battery charge/discharge optimization and gas turbine scheduling, which exhibit characteristics of complex optimization problems. We show that centroid-based clustering methods represent the operational part of the optimization problem more predictably than medoid-based approaches but are biased in objective function estimate. On certain problems that exploit intra-daily variability, such as battery scheduling, we show that k-shape improves performance significantly over conventionally-used clustering methods. Comparing all locally-converged solutions of the clustering methods, we show that a better representation in terms of clustering measure is not necessarily better in terms of objective function value of the optimization problem.},

Time-series aggregation, which reduces temporal model complexity, has emerged in recent years to address this challenge. We provide a comprehensive review of time-series aggregation for the optimization of energy systems. We show where time series affect optimization models, and define the goals, inherent assumptions, and challenges of time-series aggregation. We review the methods that have been proposed in the literature, focusing on how these methods address the challenges. This leads to suggestions for future research opportunities. This review is both an introduction for researchers using time-series aggregation for the first time and a guide to ``connect the dots'' for experienced researchers in the field. We recommend the following best practices when using time-series aggregation: (1) Performance should be measured in terms of optimization outcome and should be validated on the full time series; (2) aggregation methods and optimization problem formulation should be tuned for the specific problem and data; (3) wind data should be aggregated with extra care; (4) bounding the error in the objective function should be considered; (5) inclusion of real ``extreme days'' in addition to aggregated days can often greatly improve performance.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes different models for evaluating investments in energy storage systems (ESS) in power systems with high penetration of renewable energy sources. First of all, two methodologies proposed in the literature are extended to consider ESS investment: a unit commitment model that uses the ``system states'' (SS) method of representing time; and another one that uses a ``representative periods'' (RP) method. Besides, this paper proposes two new models that improve the previous ones without a significant increase of computation time. The enhanced models are the ``system states reduced frequency matrix'' model which addresses short-term energy storage more approximately than the SS method to reduce the number of constraints in the problem, and the ``representative periods with transition matrix and cluster indices'' (RP-TM\&CI) model which guarantees some continuity between representative periods, e.g., days, and introduces long-term storage into a model originally designed only for the short term. All these models are compared using an hourly unit commitment model as benchmark. While both system state models provide an excellent representation of long-term storage, their representation of short-term storage is frequently unrealistic. The RP-TM\&CI model, on the other hand, succeeds in approximating both shortand long-term storage, which leads to almost 10 times lower error in storage investment results in comparison to the other models analyzed.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the benefits of dynamic line rating (DLR) in the system with high penetration of wind generation. A probabilistic forecasting model for the line ratings is incorporated into a two-stage stochastic optimization model. The scheduling model, for the first time, considers the uncertainty associated with wind generation, line ratings, and line outages to co-optimize the energy production and reserve holding levels in the scheduling stage as well as the redispatch actions in the real-time operation stage. Therefore, the benefits of higher utilization of line capacity can be explicitly balanced against the costs of increased holding and utilization of reserve services due to the forecasting error. The computational burden driven by the modeling of multiple sources of uncertainty is tackled by applying an efficient filtering approach. The case studies demonstrate the benefits of the DLR in supporting cost-effective integration of high penetration of wind generation into the existing network. We also highlight the importance of simultaneously considering the multiple sources of uncertainty in understanding the benefits of DLR. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the impact of different operational strategies, the coordination among multiple flexible technologies, and the installed capacity of wind generation on the benefits of DLR.},

Two scenarios have been developed: a reference case (REF) and an advanced 100\% renewable energy scenario (ADV). ADV reflects the trends in global energy systems and will decarbonize the entire energy system by 2050. Those results are compared with the IPCC AR5 450ppm scenarios, in terms of the 2050 energy demand projections---primary and final energy---and the demands for the transport and building sectors because they are important in urban environments. The results are further discussed with regard to the impact on urban infrastructures and the role of megacities in the global energy consumption pattern. Under the assumption that urbanization rates will remain at the 2015 level until 2050, the annual energy demand for buildings in urban areas is expected to increase by 27 EJ under the reference scenario (REF), from 57EJ to 84EJ per year, whereas ADV would lead to an overall reduction to 46EJ per year by 2050, while the population and GDP continue to grow. Overall, the global energy demand in the transport sector is expected to increase by over 60\% by 2050 under REF, whereas the deep mitigation pathway (ADV) reduces the transport energy demand below that of the base year, to 70EJ per year. This is a significant reduction, even compared with other 450ppm scenarios, and can be achieved by a drastic shift to electric mobility in response to vehicle efficiency standards, a phasing-out of combustion engines in the transport sector by 2030, and a modal shift in favor of urban public transport. The global energy demand for the building sector in ADV shows a smaller deviation in comparison to other 450ppm scenarios than that for the transport sector.}

Here, we present InMAP (Intervention Model for Air Pollution), which offers an alternative to comprehensive air quality models for estimating the air pollution health impacts of emission reductions and other potential interventions. InMAP estimates annual-average changes in primary and secondary fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations---the air pollution outcome generally causing the largest monetized health damages--attributable to annual changes in precursor emissions. InMAP leverages pre-processed physical and chemical information from the output of a state-of-the-science chemical transport model and a variable spatial resolution computational grid to perform simulations that are several orders of magnitude less computationally intensive than comprehensive model simulations. In comparisons run here, InMAP recreates comprehensive model predictions of changes in total PM2.5 concentrations with population-weighted mean fractional bias (MFB) of -17\% and population-weighted R2 = 0.90. Although InMAP is not specifically designed to reproduce total observed concentrations, it is able to do so within published air quality model performance criteria for total PM2.5. Potential uses of InMAP include studying exposure, health, and environmental justice impacts of potential shifts in emissions for annual-average PM2.5. InMAP can be trained to run for any spatial and temporal domain given the availability of appropriate simulation output from a comprehensive model.

  abstract = {In the transition to renewable energy systems, fluctuating renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, plays a large and important role. This creates a challenge in terms of meeting demands, as the energy production fluctuates based on weather patterns. To utilise high amounts of fluctuating renewable energy, the energy system has to be more flexible in terms of decoupling demand and production. This paper investigates two potential ways to increase flexibility. The first is the interconnection between energy systems, for instance between two countries, labelled as cross-border interconnection, and the second is cross-sector interconnection, i.e., the integration between different parts of an energy system, for instance heat and electricity. This paper seeks to compare the types of interconnectivity and discuss to which extent they are mutually beneficial. To do this, the study investigates two energy systems that represent Northern and Southern Europe. Both systems go through three developmental steps that increase the cross-sector interconnectivity. At each developmental step an increasing level of transmission capacities is examined to identify the benefits of cross-border interconnectivity. The results show that while both measures increase the system utilisation of renewable energy and the system efficiency, the cross-sector interconnection gives the best system performance. To analyse the possible interaction between cross-sector and cross-border interconnectivity, two main aspects have to be clarified. The first part defines the approach and the second is the construction of the two archetypes.}

The possibility of energy savings through conservation or efficiency increases can be identified in, for instance, the heating and electricity sectors, in industry, and in transport. Several studies point to various optimal levels of savings in the different sectors of the energy system. However, these studies do not investigate the idea of energy savings being system dependent. This paper argues that such system dependency is critical to understand, as it does not make sense to analyse an energy saving without taking into account the actual benefit of the saving in relation to the energy system. The study therefore identifies a need to understand how saving methods may interact with each other and the system in which they are conducted. By using energy system analysis to do hourly simulation of the current Danish energy system, the combination of reductions in heat and electricity demands is analysed within the Danish district heating sector to show the benefits of coordinating savings in the electricity and district heating sectors.}

The first one is based on the number of days with snow depth greater than 5\&\#xa0;cm, and is appropriate for use with `typical' meteorological years. The second makes use of actual records of snow depth, and takes into account snow accumulation, ageing and melting to calculate reflectivity values. The algorithms were implemented in ESP-r and tested by simulating a passive solar house for six Canadian locations. The sensible heating load calculated by the simulations is reduced by up to 10.9\% on a yearly basis, and 23.3\% on a monthly basis, when the ground reflectivity takes into account the presence of snow.}

However, as different interventions are incrementally pursued in electricity systems, the resulting marginal change in emissions may differ from what one would predict based on system-average conditions. Here, we estimate average emission factors and marginal emission factors for CO2, SO2, and NOx from fossil and nonfossil generators in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region during years 2007-2016. We analyze multiple spatial scales (all MISO; each of the 11 MISO states; each utility; each generator) and use MISO data to characterize differences between the two emission factors (average; marginal). We also explore temporal trends in emissions factors by hour, day, month, and year, as well as the differences that arise from including only fossil generators versus total generation. We find, for example, that marginal emission factors are generally higher during late-night and early morning compared to afternoons. Overall, in MISO, average emission factors are generally higher than marginal estimates (typical difference: {$\sim$}20\%). This means that the true environmental benefit of an energy efficiency program may be {$\sim$}20\% smaller than anticipated if one were to use average emissions factors. Our analysis can usefully be extended to other regions to support effective near-term technical, policy and investment decisions based on marginal rather than only average emission factors.},

Therefore, we use discrete-time logistic regression analysis to estimate models of RPS adoption that include an interaction between fossil fuel production levels, and a commonly observed driver of adoption --- state government ideology. We find that conservative, moderate, and liberal state governments are likely to adopt an RPS in states with no fossil fuel production. However, only moderate and liberal governments are likely to adopt in major fossil fuel producing states.}

  abstract = {New demands for water can be satisfied through a variety of source options. In some basins surface and/or groundwater may be available through permitting with the state water management agency (termed unappropriated water), alternatively water might be purchased and transferred out of its current use to another (termed appropriated water), or non-traditional water sources can be captured and treated (e.g., wastewater). The relative availability and cost of each source are key factors in the development decision. Unfortunately, these measures are location dependent with no consistent or comparable set of data available for evaluating competing water sources. With the help of western water managers, water availability was mapped for over 1200 watersheds throughout the western US. Five water sources were individually examined, including unappropriated surface water, unappropriated groundwater, appropriated water, municipal wastewater and brackish groundwater. Also mapped was projected change in consumptive water use from 2010 to 2030. Associated costs to acquire, convey and treat the water, as necessary, for each of the five sources were estimated. These metrics were developed to support regional water planning and policy analysis with initial application to electric transmission planning in the western US.},

  abstract = {The availability of freshwater supplies to meet future demand is a growing concern. Water availability metrics are needed to inform future water development decisions. With the help of water managers, water availability was mapped for over 1300 watersheds throughout the 31 contiguous states in the eastern US complimenting a prior study of the west. The compiled set of water availability data is unique in that it considers multiple sources of water (fresh surface and groundwater, wastewater and brackish groundwater); accommodates institutional controls placed on water use; is accompanied by cost estimates to access, treat and convey each unique source of water; and is compared to projected future growth in consumptive water use to 2030. Although few administrative limits have been set on water availability in the east, water managers have identified 315 fresh surface water and 398 fresh groundwater basins (with 151 overlapping basins) as areas of concern (AOCs) where water supply challenges exist due to drought related concerns, environmental flows, groundwater overdraft, or salt water intrusion. This highlights a difference in management where AOCs are identified in the east which simply require additional permitting, while in the west strict administrative limits are established. Although the east is generally considered `water rich' roughly a quarter of the basins were identified as AOCs; however, this is still in strong contrast to the west where 78\% of the surface water basins are operating at or near their administrative limit. Little effort was noted on the part of eastern or western water managers to quantify non-fresh water resources.},

Even assuming perfect transmission of wind and solar generation aggregated over CONUS, energy storage costs would need to decrease several hundred-fold from current costs (to {$\sim\$$}1/kWh) in fully VRE electricity systems to yield highly reliable electricity without extensive curtailment of VRE generation. The role of energy storage changes from high-cost storage competing with curtailment to fill short-term gaps between VRE generation and hourly demand to near-free storage serving as seasonal storage for VRE resources. Energy storage faces ``double penalties'' in VRE/storage systems: with increasing capacity, (1) the additional storage is used less frequently and (2) hourly electricity costs would become less volatile, thus reducing price arbitrage opportunities for the additional storage.}

Conversion involves inefficiencies, losses, and embedded energy costs of infrastructures, and thus energy and dollar costs. In this study an attempt has been made to determine the magnitude and effect of this general problem, by beginning with estimates of the quantities required by different sectors and of the different forms they use. How these needs might best be met in a renewable system is then considered. Although there is insufficient data to enable confident conclusions, this ``disaggregated'' approach indicates that a 100\% renewable system to meet Australian energy demand would involve costs that would probably constitute an unacceptably large fraction of GDP.}

Each leads to total system capital costs which are well beyond affordable levels., -- The findings add to the general ``limits to growth'' case that solutions to the global energy and other sustainability problems cannot be achieved within consumer-capitalist society but must be sought via dramatic reductions in production, consumption and GDP.

Regions with less favorable renewable generation conditions benefit from this remote capacity by importing the respective electricity as power flows through the transmission grid. The resulting intricate pattern of imports and exports represents a challenge for the analysis of system costs on the level of individual countries. Using a tracing technique, we introduce flow-based nodal levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) which allow to incorporate capital and operational costs associated with the usage of generation capacity located outside the respective country under consideration. This concept and a complementary allocation of transmission infrastructure costs is applied to a simplified model of an interconnected highly renewable European electricity system. We observe that cooperation between the European countries in a heterogeneous system layout does not only reduce the system-wide LCOE, but also the flow-based nodal LCOEs for every country individually.}

We not only show that a continental-scale system is the cheapest, but also that systems on the national scale and below are possible at cost penalties of 20\% or less. Transmission is key to low cost, but it is not necessary to vastly expand the transmission system. When electricity is transmitted only to balance fluctuations, the transmission grid size is comparable to today's, albeit with expanded cross-border capacities. The largest differences across scales concern land use and thus social acceptance: in the continental system, generation capacity is concentrated on the European periphery, where the best resources are. Regional systems, in contrast, have more dispersed generation. The key trade-off is therefore not between geographic scale and cost, but between scale and the spatial distribution of required generation and transmission infrastructure.},

We use integrated assessment models (IAMs) to compute marginal damages for PM2.5-related emissions for each county in the contiguous United States and match location-specific emissions with these marginal damages to compute economy-wide gross external damage (GED) due to premature mortality. We note 4 key findings: First, economy-wide, GED has decreased by more than 20\% from 2008 to 2014. Second, while much of the air pollution policies have focused to date on the electricity sector, damages from farms are now larger than those from utilities. Indeed, farms have become the largest contributor to air pollution damages from PM2.5-related emissions. Third, 4 sectors, comprising less than 20\% of the national gross domestic product (GDP), are responsible for {$\sim$}75\% of GED attributable to economic activities. Fourth, uncertainty in GED estimates tends to be high for sectors with predominantly ground-level emissions because these emissions are usually estimated and not measured. These findings suggest that policymakers should target further emissions reductions from such sectors, particularly in transportation and agriculture.}

  abstract = {Intermittent solar and wind availabilities pose design and operational challenges for renewable power systems because they are asynchronous with consumer demand. To align this supply-demand mismatch, optimizationbased design and scheduling models have been developed to minimize the capital and operational costs associated with power production and energy storage. However, hourly time discretization and large time horizons used to describe short- and long-term solar and wind dynamics, demand fluctuations, \& price changes significantly increase the computational burden of solving these models. A decomposition algorithm based on agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) is developed to alleviate the model complexity and optimize the system over representative time periods, instead of every hour. An advantage for AHC compared to other clustering methods is the preservation of time chronology, which is important for energy storage applications. The algorithm is applied to investigate a renewable power system with battery storage in New York City. Results show that a few representative time periods (5--15 days) sufficiently capture the system performance within 5\% of the true optimal solution. The decomposition algorithm is suitable for investigating any optimization problem with time series data.},

  abstract = {The increase of renewable sources in the power sector is an important step towards more sustainable electricity production. However, introducing high shares of variable renewables, such as wind and solar, cause dispatchable power plants to vary their output to fulfill the remaining electrical demand. The environmental impacts related to potential future energy systems in Ireland for 2025 with high shares of wind power were evaluated using life cycle assessment (LCA), focusing on cycling emissions (due to part-load operation and start-ups) from dispatchable generators. Part-load operations significantly affect the average power plant efficiency, with all units seeing an average yearly efficiency noticeably less than optimal. In particular, load following units, on average, saw an 11\% reduction. Given that production technologies are typically modeled assuming steady-state operation at full load, as part of LCA of electricity generation, the efficiency reduction would result in large underestimation of emissions, e.g. up to 65\% for an oil power plant. Overall, cycling emissions accounted for less than 7\% of lifecycle CO2, NOx and SO2 emissions in the five scenarios considered: while not overbalancing the benefits from increasing wind energy, cycling emissions are not negligible and should be systematically included (i.e. by using emission factors per unit of fuel input rather than per unit of power generated). As the ability to cycle is an additional service provided by a power plant, it is also recommended that only units with similar roles (load following, mid merit, or base load) should be compared. The results showed that cycling emissions increased with the installed wind capacity, but decreased with the addition of storage. The latter benefits can, however, only be obtained if base-load electricity production shifts to a cleaner source than coal. Finally, the present study indicates that, in terms of emission reductions, the priority for Ireland is to phase out coal-based power plants. While investing in new storage capacity reduces system operating costs at high wind penetrations and limits cycling, the emissions reductions are somewhat negated when coupled with base load coal.}

  abstract = {We investigate the impacts on the biophysical economy, employment and environment of a transition scenario to an energy-efficient, 100\% renewable electricity (RE) system by 2060, based on wind, solar and biomass technologies, and an introduction of electric vehicles. We employ a CSIRO process-based model of the physical activity of Australia's economy and environmental resources, the Australian Stocks and Flows Framework. The RE systems are assumed to be manufactured in Australia to identify possible employment benefits. In comparison with the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, on a national scale, the RE scenario has much lower economy-wide net emissions, remaining below contemporary levels and becoming zero in the electricity sector by 2060. Compared with BAU, the RE scenario also has significantly lower industrial water use, somewhat higher materials use, slightly lower unemployment, lower net foreign debt (relative to a GDP proxy) and, resulting from the growth in electric vehicles, reduced oil imports. The GDP per capita growth, based on the physical stocks of capital and labour, is virtually the same in both scenarios. Hence, from the viewpoint of the biophysical economy, there are no major barriers to implementing policies to facilitate the transition to a 100\% renewable electricity system for Australia.}

  abstract = {LCOE (levelized costs of electricity) are a common metric for comparing power generating technologies. However, there is criticism particularly towards evaluating variable renewables like wind and solar PV (photovoltaics) power based on LCOE because it ignores variability and integration costs. We propose a new metric System LCOE that accounts for integration and generation costs. For this purpose we develop a new mathematical definition of integration costs that directly relates to economic theory. As a result System LCOE allow the economic comparison of generating technologies and deriving optimal quantities in particular for VRE (variable renewable sources). To demonstrate the new concept we quantify System LCOE from a simple power system model and literature values. We find that at high wind shares integration costs can be in the same range as generation costs of wind power and conventional plants in particular due to a cost component ``profile costs'' captured by the new definition. Integration costs increase with growing wind shares and might become an economic barrier to deploying VRE at high shares. System LCOE help understanding and resolving the challenge of integrating VRE and can guide research and policy makers in realizing a cost-efficient transformation towards an energy system with potentially high shares of variable renewables.}

This paper points towards this relevance, using the example of a longitudinal study of public objections to a 21.5MWe bioenergy gasifier proposed for Winkleigh in Devon, England. Local opinion surveys in 2004 and 2007 showed that public opposition to the proposed gasifier remained strong but also revealed some statistically significant change and correlations of wider interest. In the context of the environmental psychology literature, the dominant model of contextualised values, intention and behaviour, as well as other psychological approaches, are found to be helpful, both for making sense of the results and for informing a psychological research agenda on public objection to new energy infrastructure.},

While both RPS and non-RPS SCs experienced increases in renewable energy generation over the sample time period, we do not find evidence that RPS states have experienced increases in renewable energy generation relative to SCs and weak evidence of emissions reductions.}

  abstract = {Purpose The long-term marginal electricity supply mixes of 40 countries were generated and integrated into version 3.4 of the ecoinvent consequential database. The total electricity production originating from these countries accounts for 77\% of the current global electricity generation. The goal of this article is to provide an overview of the methodology used to calculate the marginal mixes and to evaluate the influence of key parameters and methodological choices on the results. Methods The marginal mixes are based on public energy projections from national and international authorities and reflect the accumulated effect of changes in demand for electricity on the installation and operation of new-generation capacities. These newly generated marginal mixes are first examined in terms of their compositions and environmental impacts. They are then compared to several sets of alternative electricity supply mixes calculated using different methodological choices or data sources. Results and discussion Renewable energy sources (RES) as well as natural gas power plants show the highest growth rates and usually dominate the marginal mixes. Nevertheless, important variations may exist between the marginal mixes of the different countries in terms of their technological compositions and environmental impacts. The examination of the modeling choices reveals substantial variations between the marginal mixes integrated into the ecoinvent consequential database version 3.4 and marginal mixes generated using alternative modeling options. These different modeling possibilities include changes in the methodology, temporal parameters, and the underlying energy scenarios. Furthermore, in most of the impact categories, average (i.e., attributional) mixes cause higher impact scores than marginal mixes due to higher shares of RES in marginal mixes. Conclusions Accurate and consistent data for electricity supply is integrated into a consequential database providing a strong basis for the development of consequential Life Cycle Assessments. The methodology adopted in this version of the database eliminates several shortcomings from the previous approach which led to unrealistic marginal mixes in several countries. The use of energy scenarios allows the evolution of the electricity system to be considered within the definition of the marginal mixes. The modeling choices behind the electricity marginal mix should be adjusted to the goal and scope of individual studies and their influence on the results evaluated.},

This paper identifies six `variables' that can hamper the comparison between different public perception studies, and offers two broad conclusions. On aggregate, proximity does have strong influence on public attitudes to proposed projects, but the nature, strength and spatial scale of this effect may vary according to local context and `value' of the land. Residents of stigmatised places are more likely to welcome facilities that are relatively `green', while people who derive a more positive sense of identity from particular rural landscapes are likely to resist such potential developments, especially if they also live there. Secondly, the fear of being branded a NIMBY, and the positive ethics associated with the notion of renewable are both likely to `colour' the responses of many interviewees. These aspects need to be clarified and accounted for in analyses of elicited responses, both quantitative and qualitative, if we are to improve our understanding of the social construction of individual attitudes in siting conflicts.},

  abstract = {This article investigates possible evolution pathways for the transport sector during the 21st century, globally and in Europe, under a climate change control scenario. We attempt to shed light on the question how the transport sector should best be decarbonized. We perform our study with the global bottom-up energy systems model TIAM-ECN, a version of the TIAM model that is broadly used for the purpose of developing energy technology and climate policy scenarios, which we adapted for analyzing in particular the transport sector. Given the global aggregated perspective of TIAM-ECN, that in its current version yields at every point in time a single CO2 price for different forms of energy use across geographic regions and economic sectors, it generates a decarbonization process that for the transport sector occurs later in time than for the power sector. This merely reflects that emission reductions are generally cheaper for electricity production than for transportation, and that it is thus cost-minimizing to spend limited financial resources available for CO2 emissions abatement in the power sector first. In our scenarios the use of hydrogen in internal combustion engines and fuel cells, rather than electricity as energy carrier and batteries to store it, gradually becomes the dominant transport technology. This outcome is in agreement with some recent publications but is at loggerheads with the current popularity of the electric car. Based on sensitivity analysis we conclude that even if the establishment of a hydrogen infrastructure proves about an order of magnitude more costly than modeled in our base case, electricity based transportation only broadly emerges if simultaneously also the costs of electric cars go down by at least 40\% with respect to our reference costs. One of the explanations for why the electric car is today, by e.g. entrepreneurs, often considered the supposed winner amongst multiple future transportation options is that the decision horizon of many analysts is no more than a few decades, instead of a full century. Electric cars fit better the current infrastructure than hydrogen fueled vehicles, so that from a short time perspective (covering the next decade or two) investments are not optimally spent by establishing an extensive hydrogen distribution network. Hence the path-dependency created by the present existence of a vast power transmission and distribution network can make electricity the most efficient choice for transportation, but only if the time frame considered is short. Electric transportation generally proves the more expensive alternative in our long-term perspective, except when electric car costs are assumed to drop substantially.}

  abstract = {Although the transition to renewable energies will intensify the global competition for land, the potential impacts driven by solar energy remain unexplored. In this work, the potential solar land requirements and related land use change emissions are computed for the EU, India, Japan and South Korea. A novel method is developed within an integrated assessment model which links socioeconomic, energy, land and climate systems. At 25--80\% penetration in the electricity mix of those regions by 2050, we find that solar energy may occupy 0.5--5\% of total land. The resulting land cover changes, including indirect effects, will likely cause a net release of carbon ranging from 0 to 50 gCO2/kWh, depending on the region, scale of expansion, solar technology efficiency and land management practices in solar parks. Hence, a coordinated planning and regulation of new solar energy infrastructures~should be enforced to avoid a significant increase in their life cycle emissions through terrestrial carbon losses.},

  abstract = {Solar photovoltaics (PV) is already the cheapest form of electricity generation in many countries and market segments. Market prices of PV modules and systems have developed so fast that it is difficult to find reliable up to date public data on real PV capital (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX) on which to base the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) calculations. This paper projects the future utility-scale PV LCOE until 2050 in several European countries. It uses the most recent and best available public input data for the PV LCOE calculations and future projections. Utility-scale PV LCOE in 2019 in Europe with 7\% nominal weighted average cost of capital (WACC) ranges from 24 {\texteuro}/MWh in Malaga to 42 {\texteuro}/MWh in Helsinki. This is remarkable since the average electricity day-ahead market price in Finland was 47 {\texteuro}/MWh and in Spain 57 {\texteuro}/MWh in 2018. This means that PV is already cheaper than average spot market electricity all over Europe. By 2030, PV LCOE will range from 14 {\texteuro}/MWh in Malaga to 24 {\texteuro}/MWh in Helsinki with 7\% nominal WACC. This range will be 9 to 15 {\texteuro}/MWh by 2050, making PV clearly the cheapest form of electricity generation everywhere. Sensitivity analysis shows that apart from location, WACC is the most important input parameter in the calculation of PV LCOE. Increasing nominal WACC from 2 to 10\% will double the LCOE. Changes in PV CAPEX and OPEX, learning rates, or market volume growth scenarios have a relatively smaller impact on future PV LCOE.},

  abstract = {The establishment of an optimal mix of renewable energy sources (RES) is pertinent to creating low-carbon energy systems with adequate load-following capabilities. Transitioning from a fossil fuel-based energy system to a system based on RES is a process in which the RES penetration must be guided by specific targets in the medium term. Moreover, the relative contributions from RES and fossil fuels in every stage of the transition process must be identified through clear optimization criteria. In this article, we propose a methodology denoted the Minimum Total Mix Capacity (MTMC) to determine the optimal mix of RES and fossil fuels in an electricity system by taking into account the hourly values of RES production and electricity demand. The MTMC methodology is applied to the Mexican electricity system, which greatly depends on fossil fuels. The Mexican Congress mandated that the fossil fuel-based electricity generation be limited to 65\% by the year 2024, 60\% by 2035 and 50\% by 2050. We use the MTMC methodology to investigate the potential for RES integration into the Mexican electricity system by constructing three scenarios (low, mid and high biomass) to achieve the 2024 target and analyze the system's response to varying contributions of wind and solar power production to the scenarios. The minimum complementary capacity based on fossil fuels that is needed to cover the demand without electricity imports is assessed to determine the total mix capacity for the transition system. Using the MTMC methodology, several combinations of biomass, wind and solar power that achieve a minimum of 35\% RES electricity production are identified; however, there is only one combination that results in the minimum overall capacity, hence resulting in the optimal mix. Moreover, a domain of near-optimal mix combinations can be identified among all of the scenarios, which may also be considered as an alternative. Biomass has the highest effectiveness in terms of high RES production and the lowest required overall power generating capacity.}

The majority of solar radiation datasets are derived from publically available data, though there are an increasing number of proprietary datasets being developed and marketed. Most of these new datasets represent models based on satellite images and validated with ground measured data. This paper focuses on the strengths and weaknesses of the existing publically available solar radiation databases, though the commentary is equally relevant to the newer commercial datasets. While the financing community generally views the solar resource as stable, it also views the material miscalculation of the solar resource as one of the biggest risks in a solar project. Therefore, lenders and rating agencies alike require verification of the solar resource dataset to be utilized at each project location as this translates directly into electric energy production forecasts and revenues. The variability of the solar resource as exhibited by the historical solar data and the accuracy of the dataset play significant roles in estimating the probability of future performance and influences the financial contract that the project is likely to receive.}

  abstract = {The increasing interconnectedness of energy and water systems makes it important to understand how interannual variations in water availability---and climate oscillations---could potentially impact the electric grid operations. The authors assess the vulnerability of the current western U.S. grid to historical climate variability using multiple energy and water system models. A 55-yr-long natural water availability benchmark is combined with the 2010 level of water demand from an integrated assessment model to drive a large-scale water management model over the western United States. The regulated flow at hydropower and thermoelectric power plants is then translated into boundary conditions for electricity generation in a production cost model. This analysis focuses on assessing regional interdependencies and the impact of interannual changes in water availability on power system operations, including reliability, cost, and carbon emissions. Results for August grid operations---when stress on the grid is often highest---show a range of sensitivity in production cost (--8\% to +11\%) and carbon emissions (--7\% to +11\%), as well as a 1-in-10 chance that electricity demand will exceed estimated supply. The authors also show that operating costs are lower under neutral El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions than under other ENSO phases; carbon emissions are highest under La Ni{\~n}a conditions, especially in California; and the risk of brownouts may be higher under neutral and negative ENSO conditions. These results help characterize the grid's performance under historical climate variations, are useful for seasonal and multiyear planning of joint water--electricity management, and can be used to support impact, adaptation, and vulnerability analyses.}

Some analyses provide cost estimation for CCS as a generic value, giving only a few distinctive technical options and only a few attempts to investigate the costs separately for each technology. The objective of this paper is therefore to analyze the cost spectrum for CCS provided by different studies and to determine realistic cost estimations for carbon dioxide capture and storage, as well as to investigate the impact of costs on the economic maturity of CCS. Results show that costs of CCS vary significantly along the CCS process chain. Furthermore, it becomes apparent that further efforts need to be taken, both in technology development and in terms of the willingness of an economy to pay high prices for mitigating CO2 emissions, before CCS may be referred to as economic feasible.}

  abstract = {The potential implementation of measures intended for energy-e\$ciency or environmental purposes (such as the prohibition of electric heating, peak shaving and the installation of cogeneration amongst others) necessitates quanti"cation methods to accurately estimate their assumed impact. Therefore, in this paper, a tool and a methodology are created to simulate and evaluate electric demand- and supply-side options. This way, the responsibility of a proposed measure with regard to emissions and energy use can be quanti"ed.Throughout the years, many (often con\#icting) views on the use of electricity have been advanced. Sometimes it was/is claimed that electricity use should be stimulated because electricity is a relatively clean source of energy (especially in countries with a lot of renewables and/or nuclear energy). Others claim that electricity use should be discouraged because it would be more e\$cient to use the primary energy sources directly, without the intermediate conversion into electricity and the associated transmission and distribution losses. Mostly, these statements cannot be justi"ed without a detailed analysis of the local energy system. To fully grasp the impact of demand-side measures it is important to understand that incremental changes in demand instantaneously only a!ect the activation of a limited amount of plants, whereas the activation of all other plants remains unchanged. Therefore, only the parameters (emissions and energy use) of this limited amount of plants are relevant, whereas the average system is not. If the change in demand is large, also the evolution of the power system may have to be altered. Then, not only the impact of the demand-side measure, but also the choices made in the planning (i.e., investments) of the power system is important. In these cases, there are no obvious conclusions, and simulations are necessary for quantitative predictions. For simple demand-side options (without alteration of the power system), the results are often not conclusive. Most of the time the overall environmental gain or loss is small, especially when an electric option is compared to a fossil alternative. The result will then also depend on the e\$ciency of the fossil option. If the demand-side option, on the other hand, creates possibilities for substantial changes in the supply-side structure, the results are dominated by the supply side. If the measure triggers the construction of a cleaner plant (e.g., a combined cycle gas-"red plant), or prevents the commissioning of a polluting plant (e.g., a coal-"red plant), it provides positive results. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Power supply is critically dependent upon water resources, particularly to cool thermoelectric plants, making the sector particularly sensitive to any shifts in the geography or seasonality of water supply. We report on results from an NSF-Funded Water Sustainability and Climate effort aimed at uncovering key energy and economic system vulnerabilities. We have developed the National Energy-Water System assessment framework (NEWS) to systematically evaluate: a) the performance of the nation's electricity sector under multiple climate scenarios; b) the feasibility of alternative pathways to improve climate adaptation; and, c) the impacts of energy technology and investment tradeoffs on the economic productivity, water availability and aquatic ecosystem condition. Our project combines core engineering and geophysical models (ReEDS [Regional Energy Deployment System], TP2M [Thermoelectric Power and Thermal Pollution], and WBM [Water Balance]) through unique digital "handshake" protocols that operate across different institutions and modeling platforms. Combined system outputs are fed into a regional-to-national scale economic input/output model to evaluate economic consequences of climate constraints, technology choices, and environmental regulation. The impact assessments in NEWS are carried out through a series of climate/energy policy scenario studies to 2050. We find that despite significant climate-water impacts on individual plants, the current US power supply infrastructure shows potential for adaptation to future climates by capitalizing on the size of regional power systems, grid configuration and improvements in thermal efficiencies. However, the magnitude and implications of climate-water impacts vary depending on the configuration of the future power sector. To evaluate future power supply performance, we model alternative electricity sector pathways in combination with varying climate-water conditions. Further, water-linked disruptions in electricity supply yield substantial impacts on regional economies yet system-level shocks can be attenuated through different technology mixes and infrastructure.}

  abstract = {The concept of dynamic rating (DR) implies that the capacity of a component varies dynamically as a function of external parameters, while the rating traditionally is based on the worst-case. The value of DR thus lies in utilizing existing equipment to a greater extent. By implementing DR and correlating the new ratings with wind power generation, more generation can be implemented. The aim is hence to facilitate connection of renewable electricity production. This paper provides two main contributions: 1) a general dynamic line rating (DLR) calculation model on overhead lines; and 2) an economic optimization simulation model regarding wind power integration comparing DLR with more traditional approaches. These models can both be implemented together, but also separately. The DLR calculation model is easy to use by companies in daily operation where the dynamic line capacity is calculated as a function of static line capacity, wind speed, and ambient temperature. The DLR calculation model is furthermore compared with more comprehensive calculations that validate that the model is accurate enough. This paper also provides an application study where both proposed models are exemplified together and evaluated. Results from this study conclude that it is a significant economic potential of implementing DR within wind power integration.},

  abstract = {As more variable renewable energy (VRE) and energy storage (ES) facilities are installed, accurate quantification of their contributions to system adequacy becomes crucial. We propose a definition of capacity credit (CC) for valuing adequacy contributions of these resources based on their marginal capability to reduce expected unserved energy. We show that such marginal credits can incentivize system-optimal investments in markets with installed capacity requirements and energy price caps. We simulated such markets using a LP-based capacity expansion planning model with convexified unit commitment (UC) constraints and ES. The impacts of UC and ES on capacity credits are investigated. Furthermore, we analyze technology and system cost distortions resulting from implementing inaccurate CCs in the capacity market. The results show that ignoring UC constraints can overestimate the CCs for VRE and ES. Building ES increases the CCs of VRE resources with higher capacity factors and a negative correlation with load. Assigning the wrong credit to VRE can significantly distort resource mixes and system cost. Implementing the proposed CCs can, in theory, eliminate those distortions and achieve the same overall optimum as a theoretical market without energy price caps.}

  abstract = {Hydropower has a key role to play in achieving carbon neutrality targets. However, the rapid development of hydropower plants and the slowdown in the growth of electricity demand can easily cause imbalances in the energy system. Therefore, this study explores the possibility of achieving deep decarbonization by 2030 in a region which has a high installed hydropower capacity and proposes solutions to the problems of water abandonment and supply-demand imbalance. This is done by developing various models and pathways to meet the electricity, industry, and transportation energy demands in Sichuan Province, China within the confinement of the government policies. Hence, three different scenarios including reference scenarios, policy scenarios, and optimization scenarios are modeled. These scenarios consider the resource development potential of renewable energy, energy policies, and the development of advanced technologies. Under different hydropower generation capacities, hybrid hydropower-photovoltaic-wind-biomass energy systems are constructed using the EnergyPLAN model, and the planning models for a clean/zero-carbon energy system in 2030 are proposed. Results from the analysis of the models showed that the conservative policy models could reduce CO2 emissions to some extent. Decarbonization models with different levels of hydropower generation under different scenarios could all result in zero CO2 emissions. The large-scale use of energy storage results in a significant increase in investment costs, but a significant reduction in energy costs. The results of this study validate the possibility of achieving decarbonization in areas with high hydropower potential. This also suggests the best decarbonization model for meeting the different needs of the future energy system. This article provides a reference and basis for any province or region to achieve long-term decarbonization using hydropower.},

With the emerging smart grid technologies and large scale integration of variables resources into the grid, the market for ancillary services is expected to grow, and thus, their prices become increasingly important. The prices of ancillary services feature different patterns and characteristics when compared to electric energy prices. The differences include lower price level, higher variability, and more frequent and extreme spikes. While electric energy prices have been broadly studied in the literature, research on features and modelling of ancillary services prices is limited. This paper investigates the application of established stochastic approaches for modelling the behavior of operating reserve and regulation prices in North American electricity markets. Such descriptive stochastic models are necessary for risk management and derivative pricing of these commodities. Mean-reverting jump-diffusion (MRJD) and Markov regime-switching (MRS) models with various specifications are analyzed. Historical prices from the Ontario and New York markets have been used for model calibration and simulation analysis. The performance of the two classes of models has been compared using various statistical measures.}

Using our model of the Australian and Indonesian electrical grids (either separately or interconnected) that incorporates operational flexibility in capacity expansion planning, we first show that meeting the projected demand for Java and Bali---the main Indonesian grid, with 100\% locally integrated renewables by 2050 would be challenging. However, a submarine high-voltage DC (HVDC) link connecting Indonesia's Java-Bali power grid to the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) grid through the Northern Territory would help alleviate this situation, given Australia's abundant renewable energy resources. Then, our model reveals that the Australian NEM could also profit from additional renewables if connected to the Northern Territory through a ground HVDC transmission line to gather intermittent wind and solar generation, which would be curtailed otherwise if unused by Indonesia through the submarine link. Despite the expensiveness of long HVDC links, the wholesale electricity cost of the integrated 100\% renewable Australasia power system could be reduced by over 16\%, from \$AUD177/MWh with only local renewables to \$AUD148/MWh with integrated HVDC transmission. The model retrieved the optimal international HVDC link with capacity of 43.8 GW, and the optimal regional HVDC transmission line with a capacity of 5.5 GW. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed model on power system decarbonisation planning for both Australian NEM and Indonesian Java-Bali power grid considering HVDC interconnections.}

In this paper, the severity of tree-caused outages in Connecticut is estimated under future-climate Hurricane Sandy simulations, each exhibiting strengthened winds and heavier rain accumulation over the study area from large-scale thermodynamic changes in the atmosphere and track changes in the year {\textasciitilde}2100 (referred to as Future Sandy). Three machine-learning models used five weather simulations and the ensemble mean of Current and Future Sandy, along with land-use and overhead utility infrastructure data, to predict the severity and spatial distribution of outages across the Eversource Energy service territory in Connecticut. To assess the influence of increased precipitation from Future Sandy, two approaches were compared: an outage model fit with a full set of variables accounting for both wind and precipitation, and a reduced set with only wind. Future Sandy displayed an outage increase of 42\%--64\% when using the ensemble of WRF simulations fit with three different outage prediction models. This study is a proof of concept for the assessment of increased outage risk resulting from potential changes in tropical cyclone intensity associated with late-century thermodynamic changes driven by the IPCC AR4 A2 emissions scenario.}

A detailed investigation of supply and demand alternatives is conducted to assess requirements for future California energy systems that can meet the 2050 GHG target. Two components are developed here that build novel analytic capacity and extend previous studies: (1) detailed bottom-up projections of energy demand across the building, industry and transportation sectors; and (2) a high-resolution variable renewable resource capacity planning model (SWITCH) that minimizes the cost of electricity while meeting GHG policy goals in the 2050 timeframe. Multiple pathways exist to a low-GHG future, all involving increased efficiency, electrification, and a dramatic shift from fossil fuels to low-GHG energy. The electricity system is found to have a diverse, cost-effective set of options that meet aggressive GHG reduction targets. This conclusion holds even with increased demand from transportation and heating, but the optimal levels of wind and solar deployment depend on the temporal characteristics of the resulting load profile. Long-term policy support is found to be a key missing element for the successful attainment of the 2050 GHG target in California.},

The fluctuating nature of these two energy carriers will pose some mature problems to energy supply systems. Solving these problems will be one of the mayor challenges in the next decades.

Simulation results are also provided. First, a novel algorithm IPSO for evaluating ELCC is presented. Second, the ELCC of wind power under different wind power permeability is studied using scenario simulation. Third, the ELCC of CWSS under diverse capacity combinations of wind power and energy storage is analyzed based on scenario simulation. Also, the superiority of IPSO is verified by comparing the results of ELCC evaluation with secant method and non-iterative smoothing spline (NISS). The simulation results show that, 1) ELCC of wind power increases with the augment of wind power permeability but finally stabilizes when wind power permeability is 60\%. 2) When the permeability of wind power is constant, ELCC of CWSS increases and then does not change basically with the addition of the maximum capacity of energy storage. 3) The permeability of wind power and the maximum capacity of energy storage augment simultaneously will not increase ELCC of CWSS indefinitely.}

Solar and wind energy are prominent renewable energy sources, and many countries around the globe are investing in these sources, which makes their installed capacity to overgrow. Both sources present an inherent variable, partly complex and unpredictable nature what imposes challenges to national grid operators to determine the available amount of power at a given moment. The spread use of both solar and wind energy could engender a complementarity behavior reducing their inherent and variable characteristics what would improve predictability and operability of the electrical grid. The study of the combined use of wind and solar power is a fundamental aspect of large-scale grid integration. Therefore, the goal of this work is to make a critical review of the state-of-the-art approaches to understand and assess the complementarity between grid-connected solar and wind power systems through the analysis of different methodologies and locations. The literature survey revealed 41 papers that were analyzed in the manuscript. The combined use of wind and solar in many places results in a smoother power supply, which is crucial for the operability and safety of electrical grids worldwide.}

  abstract = {Load following of thermal power plants becomes exceedingly difficult as dependence upon variable power generation increases. Energy storage systems (ESS) can manipulate this unpredictable generation and provide controllable power from an otherwise uncontrollable source. Modeling the interaction between these technologies and the utility grid is fundamental for understanding performance and optimizing functionality. MATLAB is used to simulate these ESS behaviors. Historic data of generation and demand taken from ISO New England and IESO Ontario is used. The model treats the ESS as a series of equations to manipulate data and demonstrate ideal ESS behaviors over given daily, monthly, and seasonal time periods. ESS placed on the generation side of the transmission system is used to stabilize variable power production and maximizing the use of transmission line capacities. ESS on the load side of the utility system is used to match demand. Results show that, using this technology, dependence upon variable generation can be increased while maintaining power balance. Effective selection of ESS size can result in greater dependence upon clean energy, reduce transmission system capacity, and decrease power production costs.}

  abstract = {The power generated by a wind turbine largely depends on the wind speed. During time periods with identical hub-height wind speeds but different shapes to the wind profile, a turbine will produce different amounts of power. This variability may be induced by atmospheric stability, which affects profiles of mean wind speed, direction and turbulence across the rotor disk. Our letter examines turbine power generation data, segregated by atmospheric stability, in order to investigate power performance dependences at a West Coast North American wind farm. The dependence of power on stability is clear, regardless of whether time periods are segregated by three-dimensional turbulence, turbulence intensity or wind shear. The power generated at a given wind speed is higher under stable conditions and lower under strongly convective conditions: average power output differences approach 15\%. Wind energy resource assessment and day ahead power forecasting could benefit from increased accuracy if atmospheric stability impacts were measured and appropriately incorporated in power forecasts, e.g., through the generation of power curves based on a range of turbulence regimes.},

NLCD2016 extends temporal coverage to 15~years (2001--2016). We collected land cover reference data for the 2011 and 2016 nominal dates to report land cover accuracy for the NLCD2016 database 2011 and 2016 land cover components at Level II and Level I and for Level I 2011--2016 land cover change using two definitions of agreement. For both the 2011 and 2016 land cover components, single-date Level II overall accuracies (OA) were 72\% (standard error of {\textpm}0.9\%) when agreement was defined as match between the map label and primary reference label only and 86\% ({\textpm} 0.7\%) when agreement also included the alternate reference label. The corresponding level I OA for both dates were 79\% ({\textpm} 0.9\%) and 91\% ({\textpm} 1.0\%). The 2011--2016 user's and producer's accuracies (UA and PA) were~{\textasciitilde}~75\% for forest loss and PA for water loss, grassland loss, and grass gain were~{$>~$}70\% when agreement included a match between the map label and either the primary or alternate reference label. Depending on agreement definition and level of the classification hierarchy, OA for the 2011 land cover component of the NLCD2016 database was about 4\% to 7\% higher than OA for the 2011 land cover component of the NLCD2011 database, suggesting that the changes in mapping methodologies initiated for production of the NLCD2016 database have led to improved product quality. Additionally, we used the reference dataset collected for assessment of the NLCD2011 database to assess the 2001 and 2006 land cover components of the NLCD2016 database. OA for the 2001 and 2006 land cover components was 1\% - 5\% lower than OA for the 2011 and 2016 land cover components of the NLCD2016 database. Higher OA for 2011 and 2016 land cover components of the NLCD2016 database relative to OA for its 2001 and 2006 components may be attributable to differences in reference data quality.},

Although a lot of data is publicly available, it is often dispersed, tedious to process and partly contains errors. We argue that a central provision of input data for modelling has the character of a public good: it reduces overall societal costs for quantitative energy research as redundant work is avoided, and it improves transparency and reproducibility in electricity system modelling. This paper describes the Open Power System Data platform that aims at realising the efficiency and quality gains of centralised data provision by collecting, checking, processing, aggregating, documenting and publishing data required by most modellers. We conclude that the platform can provide substantial benefits to energy system analysis by raising efficiency of data pre-processing, providing a method for making data pre-processing for energy system modelling traceable, flexible and reproducible and improving the quality of original data published by data providers.}

  abstract = {The applicability of the ERA5 reanalysis for estimating wind and solar energy generation over the contiguous United States is evaluated using wind speed and irradiance variables from multiple observational data sets. After converting ERA5 and observed meteorological variables into wind power and solar power, comparisons demonstrate that significant errors in the ERA5 reanalysis exist that limit its direct applicability for a wind and solar energy analysis. Overall, ERA5-derived solar power is biased high, while ERA5-derived wind power is biased low. During winter, the ERA5derived solar power is biased high by 23\% on average, while on an annual basis, the ERA5-derived wind power is biased low by 20\%. ERA5-derived solar power errors are found to have consistent characteristics across the contiguous United States. Errors for the shortest duration and most extreme solar negative anomaly events are relatively small in the ERA5 when completely overcast conditions occur in both the ERA5 and observations. However, longer-duration anomaly events on weekly to monthly timescales, which include partially cloudy days or a mix of cloudy and sunny days, have significant ERA5 errors. At 10 days duration, the ERA5-derived average solar power produced during the largest negative anomaly events is 62\% greater than observed. The ERA5 wind speed and derived wind power negative biases are largely consistent across the central and northwestern U.S., and offshore, while the northeastern U.S. has an overall small net bias. For the ERA5-derived most extreme negative anomaly wind power events, at some sites at 10 days duration, the ERA5-derived wind power produced can be less than half of that observed. Corrections to ERA5 are derived using a quantile--quantile method for solar power and linear regression of wind speed for wind power. These methods are shown to avoid potential over-inflation of the reanalysis variability resulting from differences between point measurements and the temporally and spatially smoother reanalysis values. The corrections greatly reduce the ERA5 errors, including those for extreme events associated with wind and solar energy droughts, which will be most challenging for electric grid operation.},

We address what utility planners assume about future growth of electricity demand and supply; what types of risk they consider in their long-term resource planning; and the consistency in which they report resource planning-related data. The region is anticipated to grow by 2\% annually by 2020 -- before Demand Side Management. About two-thirds of the utilities that provided an annual energy forecast also reported energy efficiency savings projections; in aggregate, they anticipate an average 6.4\% reduction in energy and 8.6\% reduction in peak demand by 2020. New natural gas-fired and renewable generation will replace retiring coal plants. Although some utilities anticipate new coal-fired plants, most are planning for steady growth in renewable generation over the next two decades. Most planned solar capacity will come online before 2020, with most wind expansion after 2020. Fuel mix is expected to remain {\textasciitilde}55\% of total generation. Planners consider a wide range of risks but focus on future demand, fuel prices, and the possibility of GHG regulations. Data collection and reporting inconsistencies within and across electric utility resource plans lead to recommendations on policies to address this issue.}

Achieving this in the United States in only 30 years will be challenging, and practical pathways detailing the technologies, infrastructure, costs, and tradeoffs involved are needed. Modeling the entire U.S. energy and industrial system with new analysis tools that capture synergies not represented in sector-specific or integrated assessment models, we created multiple pathways to net zero and net negative CO2 emissions by 2050. They met all forecast U.S. energy needs at a net cost of 0.2--1.2\% of GDP in 2050, using only commercial or near-commercial technologies, and requiring no early retirement of existing infrastructure. Pathways with constraints on consumer behavior, land use, biomass use, and technology choices (e.g., no nuclear) met the target but at higher cost. All pathways employed four basic strategies: energy efficiency, decarbonized electricity, electrification, and carbon capture. Least-cost pathways were based on {$>$}80\% wind and solar electricity plus thermal generation for reliability. A 100\% renewable primary energy system was feasible but had higher cost and land use. We found multiple feasible options for supplying low-carbon fuels for non-electrifiable end uses in industry, freight, and aviation, which were not required in bulk until after 2035. In the next decade, the actions required in all pathways were similar: expand renewable capacity 3.5 fold, retire coal, maintain existing gas generating capacity, and increase electric vehicle and heat pump sales to {$>$}50\% of market share. This study provides a playbook for carbon neutrality policy with concrete near-term priorities.},

The new assessment will incorporate some changes in the models for temperature and depth ranges for electric power production, preferred chemical geothermometers for estimates of reservoir temperatures, estimates of reservoir volumes, and geothermal energy recovery factors.

  abstract = {The United States is embarking on an ambitious transition to a 100\% clean energy economy by 2050, which will require improving the flexibility of electric grids. One way to achieve grid flexibility is to shed or shift demand to align with changing grid needs. To facilitate this, it is critical to understand how and when energy is used. High- quality end-use load profiles (EULPs) provide this information, and can help cities, states, and utilities understand the time-sensitive value of energy efficiency, demand response, and distributed energy resources. Publicly available EULPs have traditionally had limited application because of age and incomplete geographic representation (Frick, Eckman, and Goldman 2017; Frick 2019). To help fill this gap, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funded a three-year project - End-Use Load Profiles for the U.S. Building Stock - that culminated in the release of a publicly available dataset1 of simulated EULPs representing residential and commercial buildings across the contiguous United States. The motivation for this work is further detailed in a November 2019 report: Market Needs, Use Cases, and Data Gaps (Mims Frick et al. 2019). This Methodology and Results report provides detailed descriptions of how the dataset was developed, intended for an audience of dataset and model users interested in the technical details. These details include descriptions of all of the model improvements made for calibration and the final comparisons to empirical data sources. A companion report, End-Use Load Profiles for the U.S. Building Stock: Applications and Opportunities, will be published subsequently and will describe example applications and considerations for using the dataset, intended for an audience of general dataset users.},

  abstract = {Renewable portfolio standards (RPS) exist in 29 US states and the District of Columbia. This article summarizes the first national-level, integrated assessment of the future costs and benefits of existing RPS policies; the same metrics are evaluated under a second scenario in which widespread expansion of these policies is assumed to occur. Depending on assumptions about renewable energy technology advancement and natural gas prices, existing RPS policies increase electric system costs by as much as \$31 billion, on a present-value basis over 2015-2050. The expanded renewable deployment scenario yields incremental costs that range from \$23 billion to \$194 billion, depending on the assumptions employed. The monetized value of improved air quality and reduced climate damages exceed these costs. Using central assumptions, existing RPS policies yield \$97 billion in air-pollution health benefits and \$161 billion in climate damage reductions. Under the expanded RPS case, health benefits total \$558 billion and climate benefits equal \$599 billion. These scenarios also yield benefits in the form of reduced water use. RPS programs are not likely to represent the most cost effective path towards achieving air quality and climate benefits. Nonetheless, the findings suggest that US RPS programs are, on a national basis, cost effective when considering externalities.},

  abstract = {We estimate the environmental and public health benefits that may be realized if solar energy cost reductions continue until solar power is competitive across the U.S. without subsidies. Specifically, we model, from 2015 to 2050, solar power--induced reductions to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, air pollutant emissions, and water usage. To find the incremental benefits of new solar deployment, we compare the difference between two scenarios, one where solar costs have fallen such that solar supplies 14\% of the nation's electricity by 2030 and 27\% by 2050, and a baseline scenario in which no solar is added after 2014. We monetize benefits, where credible methods exist to do so. We find that under these scenarios, solar power reduces GHG and air pollutants by {$\sim$}10\%, from 2015 to 2050, providing a discounted present value of \$56--\$789 billion (central value of {$\sim\$$}250 billion, equivalent to {$\sim$}2~¢/kWh-solar) in climate benefits and \$77--\$298 billion (central value of \$167 billion, or {$\sim$}1.4~¢/kWh-solar) in air quality and public health benefits. The ranges reflect uncertainty within the literature about the marginal impact of emissions of GHG and air pollutants. Solar power is also found to reduce water withdrawals and consumption by 4\% and 9\%, respectively, including in many drought-prone states.}

  abstract = {The U.S. Department of Energy's 2022 edition of its Land-Based Wind Market Report provides an overview of key trends in the U.S. wind power market, with a focus on 2021. You can find a report, data file and presentation on the Files tab, below. Additionally, several data visualizations are available on the Visualizations tab. Despite ongoing supply chain challenges, wind energy in 2021 continued to see strong growth, technology improvements, and low prices in the U.S. Key highlights include: Wind comprises a growing share of electricity supply: U.S. wind power capacity grew at a strong pace in 2021, with the 13.4 GW of new additions representing a \${\textbackslash}\$20\$ billion investment and 32\% of all newly added U.S. generation capacity. Wind energy output rose to account for more than 9\% of the entire nation's electricity supply. At least 247 GW of wind are seeking transmission interconnection; 77 GW of this capacity are offshore wind and 19 GW are hybrid plants that pair wind with storage or solar PV. Wind project performance has increased over the decades: The average capacity factor among recently built projects was nearly 40\%, considerably higher than projects built earlier. The highest capacity factors are seen in the interior `wind belt' of the country. Turbines continue to get larger: Improved plant performance has been driven by larger turbines mounted on taller towers and featuring longer blades. In 2011, no turbines employed blades that were 115 meters in diameter or larger, but in 2021, 89\% of newly installed turbines featured such rotors. Proposed projects indicate that total turbine height will continue to rise. Low wind turbine pricing has pushed down installed project costs over the last decade: Wind turbine prices averaged \${\textbackslash}\$800\$--\${\textbackslash}\$950\$/kW in 2021, a 5\% to 10\% increase from the year prior but substantially lower than in 2010. The average installed cost of wind projects in 2021 was \${\textbackslash}\$1,500\$/kW, down more than 40\% since the peak in 2010, though relatively stable in recent years. The lowest costs were found in Texas and the (non-ISO) West. Wind energy prices are on the rise, but generally remain low, around \${\textbackslash}\$20\$/MWh in the interior of the country with higher prices in the West and East. After topping out above \${\textbackslash}\$75\$/MWh for power purchase agreements (PPAs) executed in 2009, the national average price of wind PPAs has dropped---though supply-chain pressures have resulted in increased prices in recent years. In the interior `wind belt' of the country, recent pricing is around \${\textbackslash}\$20\$/MWh. In the West and East, prices tend to average above \${\textbackslash}\$30\$/MWh. These prices, which are possible in part due to federal tax support, fall below the projected future fuel costs of gas-fired generation. Wind PPA prices are often attractive compared to wind's grid-system market value: The value of wind in wholesale power markets is affected by the location of wind plants, their hourly output profiles, and how those characteristics correlate with real-time electricity prices and capacity markets. The market value of wind increased in 2021, averaging \${\textbackslash}\$16\$/MWh in MISO, \${\textbackslash}\$19\$/MWh in SPP, \${\textbackslash}\$23\$/MWh in NYISO, \${\textbackslash}\$31\$/MWh in ERCOT, \${\textbackslash}\$33\$/MWh in PJM, \${\textbackslash}\$44\$/MWh in ISO-NE, and \${\textbackslash}\$48\$/MWh in CAISO. The average levelized cost of wind energy was \${\textbackslash}\$32\$/MWh for plants built in 2021: Levelized costs, which exclude the impacts of federal tax incentives, vary across time and geography. The national average stood at \${\textbackslash}\$32\$/MWh in 2021---down substantially historically, though relatively stable in recent years. Levelized costs were lowest in ERCOT, SPP, and the (non-ISO) West. The health and climate benefits of wind in 2021 were larger than its grid-system value, and the combination of all three far exceeds the current levelized cost of wind: Wind generation reduces power-sector emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide. These reductions, in turn, provide public health and climate benefits that vary regionally, but together are economically valued at an average of over \${\textbackslash}\$90\$/MWh-wind for plants built in 2021.},

  abstract = {We model scenarios of the U.S. electric sector in which wind generation reaches 10\% of end-use electricity demand in 2020, 20\% in 2030, and 35\% in 2050. As shown in a companion paper, achieving these penetration levels would have significant implications for the wind industry and the broader electric sector. Compared to a baseline that assumes no new wind deployment, under the primary scenario modeled, achieving these penetrations imposes an incremental cost to electricity consumers of less than 1\% through 2030. These cost implications, however, should be balanced against the variety of environmental and social implications of such a scenario. Relative to a baseline that assumes no new wind deployment, our analysis shows that the high-penetration wind scenario yields potential greenhouse-gas benefits of \$85--\$1,230 billion in present-value terms, with a central estimate of \$400 billion. Air-pollution-related health benefits are estimated at \$52--\$272 billion, while annual electric-sector water withdrawals and consumption are lower by 15\% and 23\% in 2050, respectively. We also find that a high-wind-energy future would have implications for the diversity and risk of energy supply, local economic development, and land use and related local impacts on communities and ecosystems; however, these additional impacts may not greatly affect aggregate social welfare owing to their nature, in part, as resource transfers.}

The model is designed to analyze energy technology options and policy scenarios across sectors and regions, including the increasingly important interactions between state, regional, and federal policies. FACETS contains a realistic representation of key infrastructure, while retaining the flexibility to explore deep carbon emission reductions and other large changes from the baseline energy system. It is built using a unique, flexible multi-region approach so that the geographic relationships that drive the costs of energy technology transitions can be captured. Significant enhancements to the Veda-TIMES system and a GIS-results viewer permit the massive data handling needed to represent these relationships and interpret results. An analysis of a federal clean energy standard (CES) and investment in the transmission grid is presented.}

  abstract = {A systematic framework is proposed to estimate the impact on operating costs due to uncertainty and variability in renewable resources. The framework quantifies the integration costs associated with sub-hourly variability and uncertainty as well as day-ahead forecasting errors in solar PV (photovoltaics) power. A case study illustrates how changes in system operations may affect these costs for a utility in the southwestern United States (Arizona Public Service Company). We conduct an extensive sensitivity analysis under different assumptions about balancing reserves, system flexibility, fuel prices, and forecasting errors. We find that high solar PV penetrations may lead to operational challenges, particularly during low-load and high solar periods. Increased system flexibility is essential for minimizing integration costs and maintaining reliability. In a set of sensitivity cases where such flexibility is provided, in part, by flexible operations of nuclear power plants, the estimated integration costs vary between \$1.0 and \$4.4/MWh-PV for a PV penetration level of 17\%. The integration costs are primarily due to higher needs for hour-ahead balancing reserves to address the increased sub-hourly variability and uncertainty in the PV resource.}

  abstract = {A growing number of jurisdictions are passing ambitious clean energy policies. Yet few studies have accounted for natural and agricultural land impacts of low-carbon pathways and how environmental siting constraints affect electricity costs and technology choices. To address this gap, we developed an integrated land-energy planning framework to examine the land use trade-offs of renewable energy development required to achieve ambitious clean energy goals, using the state of California as a case study. Using high-resolution ecological and agricultural datasets for 11 Western U.S. states, we modeled environmentally-constrained onshore wind, solar photovoltaic, and geothermal potential and used an electricity capacity expansion model to build generation portfolios for 2050. Here we show that California can meet its targets, but the technology mix, spatial build-out, and system costs are sensitive to land protections and availability of out-of-state renewable resources. Results suggest that failure to consider land availability in energy planning could increase uncertainties, environmental impacts, and risks in meeting subnational climate targets.},

To demonstrate, a high-resolution test system representing the United States is created using only publicly available data. This test system is validated by running it in a production cost model, with results compared against historical generation to ensure that they are representative. The resulting open source test system can support power system transition planning and aid in development of tools to answer questions around how best to reach decarbonization goals, using the most effective combinations of transmission expansion, renewable generation, and energy storage.},

We focus on future power systems, wherein net load patterns may be significantly different than they are today (e.g., due to higher renewable-energy penetrations). We examine 28 locations in the southwestern United States over an 18-year period. The hourly operation of the CSP plants are simulated to determine their potential to provide energy during an eight-hour peak-load window for each day up to 365\,days per year. Our result shows that for the large majority of locations and years, CSP plants with certain configurations (i.e., in terms of solar field and TES sizes) can provide nearly 100\% peak-load capacity. We examine also the amount of supplemental energy (e.g., by using natural gas as a supplemental thermal-energy source) that would be required to ensure that a CSP plant could serve the eight highest-load hours of every day of the year. We find that in most cases, a CSP plant supplemented with natural gas would require less than 5\% of the fuel that is used by a natural-gas fired power plant providing the same level of reliable capacity. A series of sensitivity analyses show that these results are robust to the number of peak-load hours and days that are considered and the configuration of the CSP plant.}

The analysis is based on an 80~m wind speed map generated from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data base and a set of restrictions, including proximity to transmission lines and major roads. Potential wind farm sites complying with all restrictions were populated with wind farms according to different scenarios; consecutive deployment of wind power from 1\% to 15\% system penetration was considered in all cases. In a set of one-region scenarios the evolution of the capacity credit was studied for different levels of intra-regional diversification. Near-generic decay according to a power law was observed at high penetration levels, whereas a notorious benefit was obtained from diversification at low and intermediate wind power penetration. In order to assess the potential benefits of inter-regional diversification, an optimization procedure was conducted. A significant improvement of the capacity credit decay curve was obtained for all levels of penetration. Optimal sets are characterized by a balanced utilization among regions with a relative insensitivity with respect to the exact composition of the wind farm set. The results are believed to be useful for the expansion planning of the Mexican electric grid.}

The primary aim was to compare the energy simulation results from the TMY with those from individual years and their long term means. A total of 154 simulation runs were performed. Building heating and cooling loads, their components and energy use for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning were analysed. Predicted monthly load and energy consumption profiles from the TMY tended to follow the long term mean quite closely. Mean bias errors ranged from -4.3\% in Guangzhou to 0\% in Beijing and root-mean-square errors from 3\% in Harbin to 5.4\% in Guangzhou. These percentages were not always the smallest compared with the 30 individual years, however, they are at the lower end of the percentage error ranges.

This paper uses the theory of the learning curve to investigate financing options to support grid parity for wind electricity. First, relying on a panel dataset consisting of information from 1207 wind projects in China's thirty provinces over the period of 2004--2011, this study empirically estimates the learning rate of onshore wind technology to be around 4.4\%. Given this low learning rate, achieving grid parity requires a policy of pricing carbon at 13 {\texteuro}/ton CO2e in order to increase the cost of coal-generated electricity. Alternatively, a learning rate of 8.9\% would be necessary in the absence of a carbon price. Second, this study assesses the evolution of additional capital subsidies in a dynamic framework of technological learning. The implicit average CO2 abatement cost derived from this learning investment is estimated to be around 16 {\texteuro}/ton CO2e over the breakeven time period. The findings suggest that climate finance could be structured in a way to provide up-front financing to support this paradigm shift in energy transition.}

  abstract = {As the share of variable renewable energy in power systems increases, incorporating the operational constraints in generation expansion planning has become necessary to address flexibility issues. Accordingly, to preserve chronology and to make the technically detailed planning model tractable, the model should be solved for some representative periods. Different approaches have been introduced to select representative periods; however, most of them ignore the importance of the net load. In this research, a method is proposed to include the extreme days with higher and lower levels of the net load in representative days by using self-organizing map clustering. Further, the impacts of the extreme days, with different weighting approaches, on planning and operational decisions are analyzed for single-year and multi-year planning. A simple method is also devised to find the proper number of representative days. These methods are applied to the NREL-118 and the Belgian power systems by deploying a planning model based on the unit commitment problem. It was shown that investment costs and the required dispatchable capacity are greatly underestimated if the extreme days of the net load are not considered. Besides, using self-organizing map to weight the extreme days according to their importance in the historical data resulted in 45\% improvement in approximating operating costs, a better estimation of operating variables, and a more reliable expansion for multi-year planning, demonstrating the significance of assigning proper weights to extreme days. The method for the number of representative days also performed well, especially when the extreme days were included.},

However, a significant issue that plagues the world is exploitation of fossil fuel negligently, for domestic and commercial requirements. The Government of India (GoI) has devised its renewable energy policies to encourage and promote the use of renewable energy sources in an efficient manner. In this paper, feasibility is explored for employing solar PV power generation at a wind power generation site through hybridization such that power production can be improved throughout the year. Simulation studies have been conducted for the site using RETScreen to analyze hybrid power generation at Harapanahalli in Karnataka, India. The wind farm has 18 wind turbine generator (WTG's) installed, having 2 MWe capacities each, producing 36 MWe supplied to the local grid. By using sun path and shadow analysis for the site, it is calculated that 344,531.25 m2 of shadow-free space is available which can be suitably used for alternate methods of power generation. From the present analysis, it is predicted that annual power generation capacity of the site can be improved by about 90\% on adopting hybrid power generation. The project cost is pegged at 188 crores Indian rupees (INR) and the payback period of the hybrid system was ascertained to be approximately 7 years.}

In this paper we developed an integrated solar power potential assessment framework to quantify the gap between technical potential and actual generation of solar PV farms on national, provincial, and plant scales, and identify the key factors that cause the underperformance of PV farms. Specifically, to assess technical potential, hourly meteorological reanalysis data is adopted and the power generation-related parameters are calculated (i.e. optimal panel tilt, array spacing, packing factor etc.) with consideration of their spatial variability. For actual power generation, a detailed plant-level dataset is first established by this study which integrates technical, operational, and geospatial information from 145 solar farms across seven provinces in China. Our results show that the actual PV power generation per square meter is only 1/3 of the estimated technical potential. Technological factor is the primary factor, accounting for 48.43\% of the underperformance, followed by engineering and management factors, accounting for 38.55\% and 13.02\%, respectively. The novelty of our study is revealing the underperformance level of solar farms in reality, identifying the causing factors, and highlighting the importance of integrating land-use efficiency indicators into solar power planning and development.}

A hierarchical MILP method has been proposed to solve such optimal design problems efficiently. An original problem has been solved by dividing it into a relaxed optimal design problem at the upper level and optimal operation problems which are independent of one another at the lower level. In addition, some strategies have been proposed to enhance the computation efficiency furthermore. In this paper, a method of reducing model by time aggregation is proposed as a novel strategy to search design candidates efficiently in the relaxed optimal design problem at the upper level. In addition, the previous strategies are modified in accordance with the novel strategy. This method is realized only by clustering periods and averaging energy demands for clustered periods, while it guarantees to derive the optimal solution. Thus, it may decrease the computation time at the upper level. Through a case study on the optimal design of a gas turbine cogeneration system, it is clarified how the model reduction is effective to enhance the computation efficiency in comparison and combination with the modified previous strategies.},

However, transmission line siting is often a contentious policy decision since permitting and constructing lines may involve private and public property, residents and communities, and localized and national concerns. Yet, policy conflict in transmission siting across cases and over time has remained largely understudied. This article derives and tests hypotheses about policy conflict in the context of transmission lines completed or constructed between 2017 and 2018 in the United States. In exploring the full population of transmission lines, we find that a majority exhibit relatively low and moderate levels of conflict and attention rather than high levels. We further examine a subset of six of these cases that represent a range of conflict and attention intensity. We describe variation in the diversity of actors and frames, advocacy coalitions, and the volume of discourse associated with transmission line siting over time. As problems related to energy governance have become more complex, energy siting disputes are likely to remain a fruitful area for research on policy conflict.},

This study combined an evaluation of solar energy resources in Taiwan with land use analysis, which allows the potentials and restrictions of solar energy exploitation resulting from local land use conditions to be considered. The findings unveiled in this study indicate that photovoltaic electricity generation and solar water heating have the potential of producing 36.1 and 10.2TWh of electricity and thermal energy annually in Taiwan, accounting for 16.3\% and 127.5\% of the total domestic consumption of electricity and energy for household water heating in 2009, respectively. However, the exploited solar photovoltaic power generation in 2009 accounted for only 0.02\% of total potential in Taiwan, while the exploited solar water heating accounted for 11.6\% of total potential. Market price and investment incentive are the dominant factors that affect market acceptance of solar energy installation in Taiwan. The administrative barriers to the purchase and transmission of electricity generated from renewable energy sources have to be removed before the potential contribution of solar energy can be realized.}

  abstract = {This is a case study of Wang-An Island's energy demands and potential renewable energy sources (RESs). Optimal integration of RESs was simulated using the EnergyPLAN model. The RES evaluation indicated an annual production potential of 458.1~GWh, which substantially surpassed local energy requirements of 22.3~GWh. The potential of yearly electricity generation from RESs of 299.7~GWh apparently outnumbers local electricity demand of 6.4~GWh as well, indicating that 100\% renewable electricity would be achievable if surplus electricity can be stored and then reused during an electricity deficit. Electricity production from fully exploited RESs is able to supply only 5.8~GWh of electricity mainly caused by mismatches in times of electricity demand and production. The integrated optimization can supply 3.7~GWh of electricity. A deficit of 2.68~GWh can be compensated for through electricity storage or biomass energy. Although the total amount of generated renewable electricity during the whole year cannot yet satisfy the total amount of yearly demand, electricity storage can help to satisfy most of the electricity needs for the year.}

  abstract = {Nuclear energy is a type of energy that has many advantages. Generating uninterrupted energy, not releasing carbon gas to the atmosphere and obtaining high amounts of electrical energy are examples to be given to this issue. These factors have increased the demands of countries for nuclear power plants. However, there is also a group against nuclear energy due to certain factors. Issues such as the explosion risk of the nuclear power plant and how to destroy radioactive wastes are accepted as the main reasons for this idea. On the other hand, in order for nuclear power plants to operate effectively, the country must have the necessary technological infrastructure and qualified personnel. These factors cause countries not to give priority to nuclear power plants. This study focuses on the factors that delay the establishment of nuclear power plants. In this context, first of all, a detailed literature review has been carried out on the subject. As a result of this study, 5 basic factors that will delay the establishment of nuclear power plants were determined. After that, an analysis has been conducted with the fuzzy DEMATEL method in order to determine which of the relevant factors are more important. The findings indicate that the energy reserve amount of the countries has been determined as the most important factor in opening nuclear power plants. Additionally, the expertise level and public acceptance are other significant issue in this regard. On the other hand, policy changes and technological infrastructure have lower importance for this situation. This result shows that countries resort to nuclear energy in order to reduce their dependence on foreign energy.},

  abstract = {Wind generation's contribution to supporting peak electricity demand is one of the key questions in wind integration studies. Differently from conventional units, the available outputs of different wind farms cannot be approximated as being statistically independent, and hence near-zero wind output is possible across an entire power system. This paper will review the risk model structures currently used to assess wind's capacity value, along with discussion of the resulting data requirements. A central theme is the benefits from performing statistical estimation of the joint distribution for demand and available wind capacity, focusing attention on uncertainties due to limited histories of wind and demand data; examination of Great Britain data from the last 25 years shows that the data requirements are greater than generally thought. A discussion is therefore presented into how analysis of the types of weather system which have historically driven extreme electricity demands can help to deliver robust insights into wind's contribution to supporting demand, even in the face of such data limitations. The role of the form of the probability distribution for available conventional capacity in driving wind capacity credit results is also discussed.}

  abstract = {Many countries around the world are considering using solar energy technologies in their future energy planning. The intermittency and unpredictability nature of solar power generation, which can influence the power quality and reliability of the power grid especially at large-scale solar energy systems, constitute a drawback for use of solar technology. Precise research and investigations are needed to overcome this weakness helping solar power be used in power network in large scale. The variation in sun radiation may lead to over-production of electricity from solar PV generators at one time, and lack of production to satisfy the energy demand at another time. As a result, solar PV systems demonstrate a low-level of reliability in power systems. However, an energy storage technology would play a significant role in increasing the reliability of solar power generation systems. The objectives of this study are: firstly to review the issues in relation to grid-integration of solar PV systems, secondly, to review a range of storage devices that could technically and economically be used in association with solar PV energy in order to increase the solar energy penetration level with appropriate reliability in weak electric systems, and finally to present a model for solar PV system combined with battery and super-capacitor.}

  abstract = {Large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable energy (namely wind energy and solar PV) may entail new challenges in power systems and more volatility in power prices in liberalized electricity markets. Energy storage can diminish this imbalance, relieving the grid congestion, and promoting distributed generation. The economic implications of grid-scale electrical energy storage technologies are however obscure for the experts, power grid operators, regulators, and power producers. A meticulous techno-economic or cost-benefit analysis of electricity storage systems requires consistent, updated cost data and a holistic cost analysis framework. To this end, this study critically examines the existing literature in the analysis of life cycle costs of utility-scale electricity storage systems, providing an updated database for the cost elements (capital costs, operational and maintenance costs, and replacement costs). Moreover, life cycle costs and levelized cost of electricity delivered by electrical energy storage is analyzed, employing Monte Carlo method to consider uncertainties. The examined energy storage technologies include pumped hydropower storage, compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheel, electrochemical batteries (e.g. lead--acid, NaS, Li-ion, and Ni--Cd), flow batteries (e.g. vanadium-redox), superconducting magnetic energy storage, supercapacitors, and hydrogen energy storage (power to gas technologies). The results illustrate the economy of different storage systems for three main applications: bulk energy storage, T\&amp;D support services, and frequency regulation.}

In particular, renewable energies as solar and wind pose benefits and challenges on traditional power system, e.g., they are environmentally friendly but their intermittency and seasonality is a challenge for security of supply. Though, this is not obstacle for countries to produce almost 100\% of its electricity from renewables, such is the case in Costa Rica, Paraguay and Iceland. In this context, and given multiple uncertainties tied to the spread of renewable energies, this paper uses a simulation model to analyse a scenario with 100\% renewable energy supply. This paper concludes that for the Colombian case, a large hydroelectric component and its complementarity with solar and wind reduce prices and increase energy efficiency, while helping security of supply.}

We find that a 100\% renewable European power system could operate with the same level of system adequacy as today when relying on European resources alone, even in the most challenging weather year observed in the period from 1979 to 2015. However, based on our scenario results, realising such a system by 2050 would require: (i) a 90\% increase in generation capacity to at least 1.9\,TW (compared with 1\,TW installed today), (ii) reliable cross-border transmission capacity at least 140\,GW higher than current levels (60\,GW), (iii) the well-managed integration of heat pumps and electric vehicles into the power system to reduce demand peaks and biogas requirements, (iv) the implementation of energy efficiency measures to avoid even larger increases in required biomass demand, generation and transmission capacity, (v) wind deployment levels of 7.5\,GW\,y-1 (currently 10.6\,GW\,y-1) to be maintained, while solar photovoltaic deployment to increase to at least 15\,GW\,y-1 (currently 10.5\,GW\,y-1), (vi) large-scale mobilisation of Europe's biomass resources, with power sector biomass consumption reaching at least 8.5\,EJ in the most challenging year (compared with 1.9\,EJ today), and (vii) increasing solid biomass and biogas capacity deployment to at least 4\,GW\,y-1 and 6\,GW\,y-1 respectively. We find that even when wind and solar photovoltaic capacity is installed in optimum locations, the total cost of a 100\% renewable power system ({$\sim$}530\,{\texteuro}bn\,y-1) would be approximately 30\% higher than a power system which includes other low-carbon technologies such as nuclear, or carbon capture and storage ({$\sim$}410\,{\texteuro}bn\,y-1). Furthermore, a 100\% renewable system may not deliver the level of emission reductions necessary to achieve Europe's climate goals by 2050, as negative emissions from biomass with carbon capture and storage may still be required to offset an increase in indirect emissions, or to realise more ambitious decarbonisation pathways.}

  abstract = {When optimizing the design of multi-energy systems, the operation strategy and the part-load behavior of the units must be considered in the optimization model, which therefore must be formulated as a twostage problem. In order to guarantee computational tractability, the operation problem is solved for a limited set of typical and extreme periods. The selection of these periods is an important aspect of the design methodology, as the selection and sizing of the units is carried out on the basis of their optimal operation in the selected periods. This work proposes a novel Mixed Integer Linear Program clustering model, named k-MILP, devised to find at the same time the most representative days of the year and the extreme days. k-MILP allows controlling the features of the selected typical and extreme days and setting a maximum deviation tolerance on the integral of the load duration curves. The novel approach is tested on the design of two different multi-energy systems (a multiple-site university Campus and a single building) and compared with the two well-known clustering techniques k-means and k-medoids. Results show that k-MILP leads to a better representation of both typical and extreme operating conditions guiding towards more efficient and reliable designs.},

In a first model, we propose the use of an incentive price-cap mechanism to promote the expansion of Mexican networks. In a second model, we study centrally-planned grid expansion in Mexico by an ISO within a power-flow model. We carry out comparisons of these models which provide us with hints to evaluate the actual transmission planning process proposed by Mexican authorities (PRODESEN). We obtain that the PRODESEN plan appears to be a convergent welfare-optimal planning process.}

We compare key characteristics of the different models, provide an overview of model applications, and summarize key findings on power storage requirements. We also evaluate which system values of storage are covered by respective model analyses. Based on the literature survey, we identify common findings and key model features required for a sound assessment of future storage requirements. In order to raise complementary insights, we introduce DIETER, a new dispatch and investment model. The model contributes to the literature by capturing multiple system values of power storage related to arbitrage, capacity, and reserve provision. Further, the model is designed as an open-source tool that can be freely used and modified. Results of a first application of the new model are presented in a companion paper.}

Our goal is to identify feasible EGUs and their key attributes. The results indicate that for about 60 gigawatts of the existing coal-fired capacity, the implementation of partial CO2 capture appears feasible, though its cost is highly dependent on the unit characteristics and fuel prices. Auxiliary gas-fired boilers can be employed to power a carbon capture process without significant increases in the cost of electricity generation. A complementary CO2 emission trading program can provide additional economic incentives for the deployment of CCS with 90\% CO2 capture. Selling and utilizing the captured CO2 product for enhanced oil recovery can further accelerate CCUS deployment and also help reinforce a CO2 emission trading market. These efforts would allow existing coal-fired EGUs to continue to provide a significant share of the U.S. electricity demand.}

We estimate avoided emissions using an hourly energy system simulation model, EnergyPLAN. Avoided emissions vary significantly across the country-mainly due to three state-specific factors: the existing resource mix of power plants (power grid fuel mix), the emission intensity of existing fossil fuel power plants and the PV capacity factor within each state. The avoided emissions per solar PV capacity (g/W)---for ten U.S. states---ranged from 670 to 1500 for CO2, 0.01--7.80 for SO2 and 0.25--2.40 for NOx. In general, avoided emissions are likely to be higher in locations with 1) higher share of coal plants; 2) higher emission of existing fossil fuel plants; and 3) higher PV capacity factor. To further illustrate the quantitative relationship between avoided emissions and the three state-specific factors, we conducted a sensitivity analysis. Finally, we estimated the change in avoided emissions in a coal-intensive state by varying the operational constraints of fossil-fuel power plants. At the 10\% penetration level avoided emissions were not constrained by the ramp rate limitations, but the minimum capacity requirement significantly affected the avoided emission estimates.}

Substitution effects are found between electricity and natural gas, and omitting such effects will overestimate the excess burden of carbon tax. The results indicate that carbon tax performs differently on affecting excess burden of low, middle and high income households.

Then we evaluate conditions under which delayed deployment of near-zero emission systems would result in loss of all net climate benefit (if any) from using natural gas as a bridge. Considering only physical climate system effects, we find that there is potential for delays in deployment of near-zero-emission technologies to offset all climate benefits from replacing coal energy systems with natural gas energy systems, especially if natural gas leakage is high, the natural gas energy system is inefficient, and the climate change metric emphasizes decadal time scale changes.}

  abstract = {To mitigate the global climate change and environmental issues, wind power generation is growing at a startling pace around the world. The wind power capacity credit can be used to measure the contribution of wind power resource to the capacity adequacy of a power system, thus plays an important role in development of wind power resources and expansion planning of power systems. Using the probabilistic production simulation technology, wind power capacity credits based on the capacity adequacy indexes LOLE and EUE are investigated and compared in this paper. The theoretical analysis and numerical simulation show that non-smoothness presents in variation of the LOLE index with load, while variation of the EUE index with load displays a good smoothness. This will lead to a difference in the EUE-based and the LOLE-based wind power capacity credits. In addition, the wind power capacity credits based on the LOLE index is non-monotonic for relatively small installed capacity of wind power.},

A representation of CSP performance that is suitable for incorporation into economic modeling tools is developed. We also combined existing data in order to estimate the global solar resource characteristics needed for analysis of CSP technologies. We find that, as the fraction of electricity supplied by CSP technologies grows, the application of thermal CSP technologies might progress from current hybrid plants, to plants with a modest amount of thermal storage, and potentially even to plants with sufficient thermal storage to provide base load generation capacity. The regional and global potential of thermal CSP technologies was then examined using the GCAM long-term integrated assessment model.}

  abstract = {Forests and solar energy are both critical to achieving the climate goals proposed by the Paris Agreement. However, large-scale deployment of solar farms requires vast land areas, potentially posing conflicts with other land uses. For example, solar farms have been built in forested regions or with a direct cost to forests (through deforestation). Here, we evaluated land-use conflicts between forests and established solar farms worldwide, and further assessed the energy efficiency effect of placing solar farms over forests using simulation results from seven state-of-the-art Earth system models. Our results, based on remote sensing analysis, showed that 6320 solar farms (9.14\%) exhibit land-use conflicts with forests, accounting for 4.9\% of the total solar farm area. The capacity factor (CF) of solar farms was found to decrease with increasing forest coverage because of enhanced cloud formation and reduced solar radiation. Even though deforestation was shown to be able to increase the local CF, in deforestation areas CF was still found to be lower than over open land (cropland or grassland). Moreover, the effect of a significantly increased CF following deforestation was found to take about 36 years to emerge, potentially exceeding the service lifetime of a solar farm (25--30 years). Our results highlight the fact that building solar farms over forests or through deforestation leads to no gain in energy efficiency compared to open land, and hence should only be carried out with great caution or completely discouraged.}

  abstract = {Dynamic thermal rating (DTR) is an important smart grid technology that can bring considerable economic benefits. One of the most important benefits of DTR is to postpone new investment. This paper proposes a novel stochastic transmission expansion planning (STEP) model considering the DTR of overhead lines. The objective function of the STEP model includes operational costs and the investment costs of new line construction and DTR systems installation. The model can determine where to build new lines and install DTR systems. The model cannot only realize the benefits that occur when the DTR is higher than the static thermal rating (STR) but also avoid overload risk, i.e., the power flow on a line being larger than the line's real capacity, caused by the DTR being lower than the STR. The model can consider both the voltage magnitude and phase angle of each bus. The model is linearized and therefore can be effectively solved by a Benders decomposition method. Furthermore, a new way of scenario reduction is proposed to obtain a better set of reduced scenarios. The effectiveness of the model is verified on a modified IEEE reliability test system and a modified IEEE 300-bus system.},

  abstract = {Beijing, as the capital of China, is under the high pressure of climate change and pollution. The consumption of non-renewable energy is one of the most important sources of the CO2 emissions, which cause climate changes. This paper presents a study on the energy system modelling towards renewable energy and low carbon development for the city of Beijing. The analysis of energy system modelling is organized in two steps to explore the alternative renewable energy system in Beijing. Firstly, a reference energy system of Beijing is created based on the available data in 2014. The EnergyPLAN, an energy system analysis tool, is chosen to develop the reference energy model. Secondly, this reference model is used to investigate the alternative energy system for integrating renewable energies. Three scenarios are developed towards the energy system of Beijing in 2030, which are: (i) reference scenario 2030, (ii) BAU (business as usual) scenario 2030, and (iii) RES (renewable energies) scenario 2030. The 100\% renewable energy system with zero CO2 emissions can be achieved by increasing solar energy, biomass and municipal solid waste (MSW) and optimizing heating system. The primary fuel consumption is reduced to 155.9~TWh in the RES scenario, which is 72\% of fuel consumption in the reference scenario 2030.}

  abstract = {The increasing utilization of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in future will have significant impact on utility companies and customers depending on their charging characteristics. Uncontrolled or unscheduled vehicle charging may increase the residential peak and the risk of electric distribution network failure. In order to reduce the peak load utility companies encourage customers who have such high electricity consuming devices to participate in various demand response (DR) programs. Additionally, considering increasing Photovoltaic (PV) generation and storage facility installation on customer side, the integration of PHEVs needs more attention as system's performance becomes highly fluctuating and unpredictable. This paper presents a simulation based optimization framework for integrated analysis of demand response programs, with high penetration of PHEV and PV and storage systems from residential customer's perspective as well as utility company's perspective. An agent-based simulation model is built in AnyLogic to mimic the household load, PHEV charging, PV generation and storage together with various demand response programs such as time-of-use (TOU), Real-time Pricing (RTP), and curtailment. In the considered scenarios, customers schedule their PHEV charging time and duration to minimize the electricity bill considering the price at the time of use, while the utility company aims to minimize the peak due to the PHEV charging by changing prices. The constructed simulation helps the utility company identify the best policies, and helps customers make better response under different DR programs. Three demand response programs are simulated with and without PV and storage. Results show that the simulation model successfully represents the cases and appropriate scheduling has benefits for both customers and utility companies.}

This paper reviews the state of the art of the ESS technologies for wind power integration support from different aspects. Firstly, the modern ESS technologies and their potential applications for wind power integration support are introduced. Secondly, the planning problem in relation to the ESS application for wind power integration is reviewed, including the selection of the ESS type, and the optimal sizing and siting of the ESS. Finally, the proposed operation and control strategies of the ESS for different application purposes in relation to the wind power integration support are summarized.

However, estimating the capacity credit of variable renewable energy is challenging due to the variability, uncertainty, and spatial diversity of the renewable resources. This study uses the Regional Energy Deployment System to quantify the impacts on the U.S. power sector through 2050 from misestimations of renewable capacity credit. Results show that small underestimates of the renewable capacity credit have little impact on system buildout, but that large underestimates ({$>$}50\%) can reduce solar photovoltaic deployment by nearly 100\,GW (50\%) and wind by up to 43\,GW (22.8\%) in 2030s. Such large differences are possible because the capacity credit for variable renewable energy can substantially impact the overall costs and value of variable renewable energy relative to other technologies. Such effects are most strongly felt in the mid-term but are less relevant over the long-term due to the declining value of variable resources. Underestimating the capacity credit of variable renewable energy leads to increased system costs and emissions. Conversely, overvaluing the capacity credit of variable renewable energy reduces system costs at the risk of lower reliability.

  abstract = {Summary Deeply decarbonizing electricity production will likely require that low-carbon sources meet energy demand throughout days, years, and decades. Wind and solar energy are possible low-carbon options, but resource variability can limit their reliability. Storage can help address this challenge by shaping intermittent resources into desired output profiles. But can solar and wind energy with storage cost-competitively fulfill this role? How do diverse storage technologies compare? We address these questions by analyzing systems that combine wind and solar energy with storage to meet various demand profiles. We estimate that energy storage capacity costs below a roughly \$20/kWh target would allow a wind-solar mix to provide cost-competitive baseload electricity in resource-abundant locations such as Texas and Arizona. Relaxing reliability constraints by allowing for a few percent of downtime hours raises storage cost targets considerably, but would require supplemental technologies. Finally, we discuss storage technologies that could reach the estimated cost targets.}

  abstract = {The urgency to combat climate change and the widely distributed, increasingly competitive renewable resources in North America are strong arguments to explore scenarios for a renewable energy supply in the region. While the current power system of North America is heavily dependent on fossil fuels, namely natural gas, coal and oil, and some nuclear power plants, some current policies at the state level, and future federal policies are likely to push the share of different renewable sources available in Mexico, the U.S., and Canada. This paper explores three scenarios for a renewable energy supply, using a bottom-up energy system model with a high level of spatial and time granularity. The scenarios span the extremes with respect to connecting infrastructure: while one scenario only looks at state-level supply and demand, without interconnections, the other extreme scenario allows cross-continental network investments. The model results indicate that the North American continent (a) has sufficient renewable potential to satisfy its energy demand with renewables, independent of the underlying grid assumption, (b) solar generation dominates the generation mix as the least-cost option under given renewable resource availability and (c) simultaneous planning of generation and transmission capacity expansion does not result in high grid investments, but the necessary flexibility to integrate intermittent renewable generation is rather provided by the existing grid in combination with short-term and seasonal storages.},
