## Documentation Guidelines
When making changes to ReEDS, you should generate and update the sources.csv and sources_documentation.md files before merging. 

```{include} ../documentation_tools/README.md
```

### Updating the ReEDS Documentation
The ReEDS documentation lives in the "docs/source" folder within the repo. Depending on the changes you're making to the model, please update the documentation here accordingly. See the [Getting Started with Markdown in VSCode](./markdown_cheat_sheet.md) if you're unfamiliar with markdown.

To edit the ReEDS documentation: 
1. Find the markdown file you would like to modify under the "docs/source" folder
2. Make any necessary changes and save the file
3. Commit and push your changes as you normally would. 
   * **When your pull request gets merged into main, there is a github action that will automatically recompile the documentation with your changes and publish the updated site.**

### Viewing the Documentation Locally
If you would like to see what the documentation will look like when developing locally, there are two approaches:

**Approach 1: Use the built-in markdown preview in VSCode**
1. Right click on the markdown file you want to view. Select "Open Preview". 
   * **Note:** because the documentation gets compiled using Sphinx, some things won't display properly in this view (i.e. tables, figures, and citations)
   * To view footnotes in the preview correctly, you'll need to install the "Markdown Footnotes" VSCode extension


**Approach 2: Build the documentation locally**

1. Navigate to the "docs/" folder 

2. Run the command `make html` to build the documentation locally
   * Ensure you have the 'reeds2' environment activated
  
3. From Finder/File Explorer, open the folder "/ReEDS-2.0/docs/build/html" then click on "index.html"
   * This will launch the documentation in a new internet window
   * If you make changes and wish to see how they are reflected in the documentation, you can run the `make html` command again and refresh the window you already have open

4. If you would like to remove the generated files, you can run the command `make clean` from the "docs/" folder

### Adding Citations in the Documentation
1. Download Zotero: [https://www.zotero.org/](https://www.zotero.org/)
   a. Install the "Better BibTeX for Zotero" plugin: [https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/)
   b. Turn on "Automatic export" under [Better BibTeX preferences]/[Automatic export] and adjust the filepath to {your filepath}
   c. Under [Better BibTeX preferences]/[Export][BibTeX], set "Add URLs to BibTeX export" to "in the 'url' field"

2. Request access to the ReEDS Zotero library from Jonathan, Brian, Patrick, Wesley, or Pieter

3. If you add any new references to the ReEDS Zotero library and cite them in the ReEDS docs, you'll need to:
   a. Replace the contents of ReEDS-2.0/docs/source/references.bib with the contents of the .bib file at {your path}


To add an in-text citation, find the citation key of the citation you would like to add in Zotero.

**Citation format:** 
```{table} Citation formats in markdown
:name: markdown-citation-formats

| **Markdown Syntax** | **Output** |
| ------------------- | ---------- |
| ``` {cite}`cole2020StandardScenarios2020` ``` | [Cole *et al.*, 2020] |
| ``` {cite:t}`cole2020StandardScenarios2020` ``` | Cole *et al.*, [2020] |
| ``` {cite:year}`cole2020StandardScenarios2020` ``` | 2020 |
| ``` {cite:p}`cole2020StandardScenarios2020, nrelRenewableElectricityFutures2012` ``` | [Cole *et al.*, 2020, NREL, 2020] |
| ``` {cite:p}`{see}cole2020StandardScenarios2020{pg. 2}` ``` | [see Cole *et al.*, 2020, pg. 2] |

```

Alternatively, you can use the "Zotero Citation Picker" VS Code extension for finding/adding references to the documentation. This extension requires Zotero to be installed, as well as Better BibTex for Zotero (the Better BibTex for Zotero installation guide can be found [here](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/)).


**Adding new citations to Zotero**

If you're looking to add a new citation to the ReEDS Zotero library, you can do so manually, or you can use the Zotero Connector. You can download it [here](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors).

After installing the extension, you'll need to enable it in your browser of choice. To create and save a new citation, open it in Firefox (or whatever browser you have the extension enabled), and click 'Zotero Connector' to run the extension and create a new Zotero citation.
