# Introduction ([https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/](https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/)) 

The Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) is a capacity planning and dispatch model for the North American electricity system.

As NREL&#39;s flagship long-term power sector model, ReEDS has served as the primary analytic tool for many studies ([https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/publications.html](https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/publications.html)) of important energy sector research questions, including clean energy policy, renewable grid integration, technology innovation, and forward-looking issues of the generation and transmission infrastructure. Data from the most recent base case and a suite of Standard Scenarios are provided.

ReEDS uses high spatial resolution and high-fidelity modeling. Though it covers a broad geographic and technological scope, ReEDS is designed to reflect the regional attributes of energy production and consumption. Unique among long-term capacity expansion models, ReEDS possesses advanced algorithms and data to represent the cost and value of variable renewable energy; the full suite of other major generation technologies, including fossil and nuclear; and transmission and storage expansion options. Used in combination with other NREL tools, data, and expertise, ReEDS can provide objective and comprehensive electricity system futures.

<a name="Software"></a>
# Required Software

The ReEDS model is written primarily in GAMS with auxiliary modules written in Python. R is used for the demand module, which is not active by default, and therefore need not be installed unless you plan on working with that module. At present, NREL uses the following software versions: GAMS 30.3; Python 3.6.5; R 3.4.4. Other versions of these software may be compatible with ReEDS, but NREL has not tested other versions at this time.

GAMS is a mathematical programming software from the GAMS Development Corporation. &quot;The use of GAMS beyond the limits of the free demo system requires the presence of a valid GAMS license file.&quot; [[1](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_License.html)] The ReEDS model requires the GAMS Base Module and a linear programming (LP) solver (e.g., CPLEX). The LP solver should be connected to GAMS with either a GAMS/Solver license or a GAMS/Solver-Link license. &quot;A GAMS/Solver connects the GAMS Base module to a particular solver and includes a license for this solver to be used through GAMS. It is not necessary to install additional software. A GAMS/Solver-Link connects the GAMS Base Module to a particular solver, but does not include a license for the solver. It may be necessary to install additional software before the solver can be used.&quot; [[2](https://www.gams.com/products/buy-gams/)]

NREL subscribes to the GAMS/CPLEX license for the LP solver, but open-source and free, internet-based services are also available. The [_COIN-OR Optimization Suite_](https://www.coin-or.org/downloading/) includes open-source solvers that can be linked with GAMS through the GAMS Base Module. NREL has not tested the performance of these open-source solvers for ReEDS. The [_NEOS Server_](https://neos-server.org/neos/) is a free, internet-based service for solving numerical optimization problems. Links with NEOS can be made through [_KESTREL_](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/S_KESTREL.html) which is included in GAMS Base Module. In its current form, ReEDS cannot be solved using NEOS due to the 16 MB limit on submissions to the server. However, modifications _could_ be made to ReEDS to _potentially_ reduce the data below to the required submission size.

Python is &quot;an object-oriented programming language, comparable to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, or Java.&quot; [[3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Overview)] &quot; Python is developed under an OSI-approved open source license, making it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use. Python&#39;s license is administered by the Python Software Foundation.&quot; [[4](https://www.python.org/about/)]. NREL uses Conda to build the python environment necessary for ReEDS. Conda is a &quot;package, dependency and environment management for any language.&quot; [[5](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)]

&quot;R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphicsâ€¦R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation&#39;s GNU General Public License in source code form.&quot; [[6](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)]

<a name="Setup"></a>
# Setting up your computer to run ReEDS for the first time (for Microsoft Windows 10)

The setup and execution of the ReEDS model can be accomplished using a command-line interpreter application and launching a command line interface (referred to as a &quot;terminal window&quot; in this document). For example, initiating the Windows Command Prompt application, i.e., cmd.exe, will launch a terminal window ([Figure 1](#Fig1)).

<a name="Fig1"></a>
![Image of Command Prompt](https://github.com/NREL/ReEDS_OpenAccess/blob/master/images/cmd-prompt.png)

*Figure 1. Screenshot of a Windows Command Prompt terminal window.*

**SUGGESTON:** use a command line emulator such as ConEmu ([https://conemu.github.io/](https://conemu.github.io/)) for a more user-friendly terminal. The screenshots of terminal windows shown in this document are taken using ConEmu.

**IMPORTANT:** Users should exercise Administrative Privileges when installing software. For example, right click on the installer executable for one of the required software (e.g., Anaconda3-2019.07-Windows-x86\_64.exe) and click on &quot;Run as administrator&quot; ([Figure 2](#Fig2)). Alternatively, right click on the executable for the command line interface (e.g., Command Prompt) and click on &quot;Run as administrator&quot; ([Figure 3](#Fig3)). Then run the required software installer executables from the command line.

## Automatic ReEDS Repository Setup
This method automatically sets up the user's machine to run be able to run ReEDS via `ReEDS.sh`. 

#### GAMS
Download and install the latest version of GAMS anywhere on the `C:\` drive. This method is only compatible with GAMS version 30.3 and later. Refer to the manual setup instructions if you wish to use an older version of GAMS.

#### ReEDS Code Repository
The ReEDS source code is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/NREL/ReEDS\_OpenAccess
1. Request access to the ReEDS GitHub repository at [https://nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/request-access.html](https://nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/request-access.html).
2. From the Git command line run the following command to enable large file storage.
```
git lfs install
```
3. Clone the ReEDS-2.0 repository on your desktop and use the repository with GitHub Desktop ([Figure 4](#Fig4)).

4. Run `windows_setup.sh`. This can be done by either double-clicking on it from the file explorer or opening a gitbash window in root directory of your ReEDS repository and running `./windows_setup.sh`

**Tip:** Once one ReEDS repository has been set up on a system, simply copy `.bashrc` from that repository into any other ReEDS repositories that exist on the system and presto! No more waiting for `windows_setup.sh` to run before using fresh repositories.

5. `windows_setup.sh` will prompt the user to indicate which GAMS installation to use with ReEDS. The user **must** select a GAMS version later than 30.3.

Once `windows_setup.sh` completes, the ReEDS repository will contain a symbolic link to the GAMS installation with several python packages installed.

<a name="ConfigPy"></a>
### Python Configuration

Install Anaconda: [https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section). NREL recommends Python 3.7, but has also used Python 3.6.5 and 3.7.1 successfully.

**IMPORTANT** : Be sure to download the Windows version of the installer.

Add Python to the &quot;path&quot; environment variable

1. In the Windows start menu, search for &quot;environment variables&quot; and click &quot;Edit the system environment variables&quot; ([Figure 5](#Fig5)). This will open the &quot;System Properties&quot; window ([Figure 6](#Fig6)).
2. Click the &quot;Environment Variables&quot; button on the bottom right of the window ([Figure 6](#Fig6)). This will open the &quot;Environment Variables&quot; window ([Figure 7](#Fig7)).
3. Highlight the Path variable and click &quot;Edit&quot; ([Figure 7](#Fig7)). This will open the &quot;Edit environment variable&quot; window ([Figure 8](#Fig8)).
4. Click &quot;New&quot; ([Figure 8](#Fig8)) and add the directory locations for \Anaconda\ and \Anaconda\Scripts to the environment path.

**IMPORTANT** : Test the Python installation from the command line by typing &quot;python&quot; (no quotes) in the terminal window. The Python program should initiate ([Figure 9](#Fig9)).

Install the gdxpds package from the command line by typing &quot;pip install gdxpds&quot; (no quotes) in the terminal window ([Figure 10](#Fig10)).The gdxpds package is required for reading GAMS Data Exchange files (.gdx) into Python.

<a name="ConfigGAMS"></a>
### GAMS Configuration

Install GAMS: [https://www.gams.com/download-old/](https://www.gams.com/download-old/). NREL uses GAMS version 30.3. Older versions might also work, and newer versions have not been tested. A valid GAMS license must be installed. Please refer to the [Required Software](#Software) section above for more information.

If you are using GAMS 24.9 or newer, then GAMS will default to using the Python version that is included with GAMS. This GAMS version of Python needs some packages to be installed in order to work with ReEDS. To install those packages, navigate to the GMSPython directory in the GAMS folder (e.g., C:\GAMS\win64\30.3\GMSPython) in the terminal window. Install the packages using &quot;python -m pip install [package name]&quot;. The packages to install are gdxpds, xlrd, jinja2, and bokeh.

Add GAMS to the &quot;path&quot; environment variable. Follow the same instructions as for adding Python to the path in the [Python Configuration](#ConfigPy) section above. Append the environment path with the directory location for the _gams.exe_ application (e.g., C:\GAMS\win64\30.3).

**IMPORTANT** : Test the GAMS installation from the command line by typing &quot;gams&quot; (no quotes) in the terminal window. The GAMS program should initiate (Figure 10).

<a name="Fig10"></a>
![Image of Test GAMS](https://github.com/NREL/ReEDS_OpenAccess/blob/master/images/gams-test.png)

*Figure 10. Screenshot of a test of GAMS from the terminal window.*

<a name="ConfigR"></a>
### R Configuration
**Note: R is only necessary for the ReEDS demand module. It is reccomended that this section be skipped unless that module is needed for your intended application of ReEDS**

Install R 3.4.4: [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/3.4.4/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/3.4.4/). NREL has observed compatibility issues with other versions of R. NREL has not tested R versions more recent than 3.4.4. Optionally, install RStudio: [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

Add R to the &quot;path&quot; environment variable. Follow the same instructions as for adding Python to the path in the [Python Configuration](#ConfigPy) section above. Append the environment path with the directory location for the _R.exe_ and _Rscript.exe_ applications (e.g., C:\Program Files\R\R-3.4.4\bin\).

**IMPORTANT** : Test the R installation from the command line by typing "r" (no quotes) in the terminal window. The R program should initiate ([Figure 11](#Fig11)).

Install R packages necessary for ReEDS from the command line. Navigate to the ReEDS directory in the terminal window and enter:
```
rscript demand\packagesetup.R
``` 
The Rscript.exe program will install a suite of R packages ([Figure 12](#Fig12)).

<a name="Execution"></a>
# Executing the Model

The execution of the ReEDS model can be accomplished by using a command-line interpreter application and launching a command line interface.

A ReEDS case (also referred to as a &quot;run&quot;, &quot;scenario&quot; or &quot;instance&quot;) is executed through a python-based case batching program called &quot;runbatch.py&quot;. The user can execute a single case or a batch of cases using this program.

**Step 1** : Specify the ReEDS case name(s) and configuration(s) in the case configuration file. ([Figure 13](#Fig13)). The default case configuration file name is called &quot;cases.csv&quot;, but the user may create custom case configuration files by using a suffix in the file name (e.g., &quot;cases\_test.csv&quot;). The file &quot;cases\_test.csv&quot; can be used to execute a &quot;test&quot; version of the model for the ERCOT system.

Within &quot;cases.csv&quot;, The data in Column A are the model &quot;switches&quot; (also referred to as &quot;options&quot;). The data in Column B are brief descriptions of the switches. The data in Column C are the default values of the switches. The case configuration (or set of switches that define a case) begin with Column D. Each case configuration is represented by a single column. The case name is specified in Row 1. The value for each switch is specified beginning in Row 2. If a switch value is left blank, default value from Column C is used. A complete list of switches is provided in the Appendix of this document.

<a name="Fig13"></a>
![Image of Cases.csv](https://github.com/NREL/ReEDS_OpenAccess/blob/master/images/cases-csv.png) 

*Figure 13. Screenshot of cases.csv.*

**Step 2** : Initiate the case batching program

1. Navigate to the ReEDS model directory in the file explorer or gitbash window.
2. Run `ReEDS.sh`. Alternatively, if ReEDS was set up using the manual procedure above, enter `python runbatch.py` in a command prompt (be sure to be in the ReEDS directory) to run the ReEDS case batching program ([Figure 14](#Fig14)).
3. Provide responses to the suite of prompts in the command line ([Figure 15](#Fig15)). Please refer to the [Prompts for user input during runbatch.py](#Prompts) section below for more information about the prompts.
4. Once all responses have been received, the batching program will execute the case(s) specified in the case configuration file (e.g., &quot;cases.csv&quot;). A separate terminal window will be launched for each case ([Figure 16](#Fig16)).

**Step 3** : Wait for each case to finish, check for successful completion, and view outputs. Once a case has finished (either from successful completion or from an error), the case-specific terminal window will close and a message in the main terminal window (i.e., where &quot;runbatch.py&quot; was initiated) will appear stating that the case has completed ([Figure 17](#Fig17)).

<a name="Prompts"></a>
## Prompts for user input during &quot;runbatch.py&quot;

When a user initiates a batch of ReEDS cases through &quot;runbatch.py&quot;, a suite of prompts will appear in the terminal window. Additional details about these prompts are provided below.

**Batch Prefix** **[string]** â€“ Defines the prefix for files and directories that will be created for the batch of cases to be executed (as listed in a case configuration file, e.g., &quot;cases.csv&quot;).

- All files and directories related to a case will be named &quot;_{batch prefix}\_{case}&quot;_. For example, if _batch prefix_=&quot;test&quot; and _case_=&quot;ref\_seq&quot;, then all files and directories related to this case will be named _test\_ref\_seq._ All files and directories for ReEDS cases are stored in a directory called &quot;\runs&quot; 
- **WARNING! A batch prefix cannot start with a number given incompatibility with GAMS.** The GAMS model declaration statement is as follows:

```
model {batch prefix}_{case} /all/ ;
```

Therefore, &quot;batch prefix&quot; CANNOT begin with a numeric and SHOULD begin with an alpha character (e.g., a, A, b, B, â€¦).

- Entering a value of &quot;0&quot; (zero, no quotes) will assign the current date and time for the batch prefix in the form of _v{YYYYMMDD}\_{HHMM}_. Note the preceding letter vee &#39;v&#39; is necessary to ensure the batch prefix begins with an alpha character.  For example, if _batch prefix_=&quot;0&quot; and _case_=&quot;ref\_seq&quot; on September 30, 2019 at 3:00 PM (1500 hours military time), then all files and directories related to this case will be named _v20190930\_1500\_ref\_seq_
- **WARNING! Avoid re-using a (batch prefix, case) pair**. If a directory &quot;\runs\{batch prefix}\_{case}&quot; already exists, a warning will be issued in the case-specific terminal window, but &quot;runbatch.py&quot; will overwrite data in the existing case directory ([Figure 18](#Fig18)). In some instances, the case execution will pause, and a message will appear in the case-specific terminal window &quot;mv: replace [â€¦] overriding mode 0666?&quot; ([Figure 19](#Fig19)). Pressing &quot;Enter/Return&quot; will continue the execution. NREL plans to address this overwriting issue in the future by requiring user approval to overwrite an existing case directory.

 <a name="Fig18"></a>
![Image of Duplicate Case Warning](https://github.com/NREL/ReEDS_OpenAccess/blob/master/images/duplicate-case.png)  

*Figure 18. Screenshot of warning message that appears in the main terminal window when reusing a (batch prefix, case) pair.*

 <a name="Fig19"></a>
![Image of Duplicate Case Warning 2](https://github.com/NREL/ReEDS_OpenAccess/blob/master/images/duplicate-case-2.png)  
 
*Figure 19. Screenshot of warning message that occurs in the case-specific terminal window when reusing a (batch prefix, case) pair.*

**Case Suffix [string]**â€“ Indicates which case configuration fileâ€”in the form &quot;cases\_{case suffix}.csv&quot;â€”is ingested into &quot;runbatch.py&quot; for processing.

- Entering an empty value (i.e., pressing &quot;Enter/Return&quot;) will cause the default case configuration file &quot;cases.csv&quot; to be used.
- **SUGGESTION** : Users may want to create a custom case configuration file (&quot;cases\_{â€¦}.csv&quot;) when executing scenarios that vary from the default case configuration file (&quot;case.csv&quot;).

**Number of Simultaneous Runs [integer]** â€“ Indicates how many cases should be run simultaneously in parallel.

- &quot;runbatch.py&quot; uses a queue to execute multiple cases.
- If there are four (4) cases and the _Number of Simultaneous Runs_=1, then &quot;runbatch.py&quot; will execute the cases one at a time.
- If there are four (4) cases and the _Number of Simultaneous Runs_=2, then &quot;runbatch.py&quot; will start two (2) cases simultaneously. Then as each case finishes a new one will start until all cases have been run.
- **WARNING**! **Be mindful about the amount of CPU and RAM usage needed for each case.**
  - Table 4 in the [What computer hardware is necessary to run ReEDS?](#Hardware) section below provides some initial data points for CPU and RAM usage.
  - An Intertemporal solve will take significant resources unless simplified (through the case configuration).
  - A Sequential solve has default value of four (4) threads in &quot;cplex.opt&quot;. The number of threads can be reduced, requiring less CPU resource usage.

**Number of simultaneous CC/Curt runs [integer]** â€“ Indicates how many threads are to be used for the capacity credit (CC) and curtailment (curt) batching program (&quot;reflowbatch.py&quot;).

- This question is only asked when running intertemporal cases (i.e., timetype=&quot;int&quot; in the case configuration file).
- With the intertemporal case, the linear program is formulated and solved for all years at once. Then the capacity credit and curtailment calculations are executed in parallel based on the _Number of simultaneous CC/Curt runs_ specified by the user.

**How many iterations between the model and CC/Curt scripts [integer]**_â€“_ For an intertemporal case, the &quot;runbatch.py&quot; will execute an LP solve and then call the cc/curt scripts. The value assigned here determines how many of these iterations between the LP and the cc/curt scripts occur.

- This question is only asked when running intertemporal cases (i.e., timetype=&quot;int&quot; in the case configuration file).
- **SUGGESTION** : When executing an intertemporal case, it is good practice to set &quot;cc\_curt\_load = 1&quot; in &quot;cases.csv&quot; to enable pre-computed starting values for capacity credit and curtailment.
- Currently, there is no convergence criterion enforced. Typically, 5-6 iterations are enough for convergence, i.e., the capacity credit and curtailment values have &quot;small&quot; deviations since the prior iteration.

# Runbatch.py Execution Protocol

Below are the key steps that occur when a user initiates &quot;runbatch.py&quot;. Knowing these steps may help the user understand the source code of &quot;runbatch.py&quot; if modifications need to be made to the batching program.

1. Request input from user though the command prompt.
2. Ingest case names and case switches from the user-specified case configuration file (e.g., &quot;cases.csv&quot;)
3. Create a new directory for each case (\runs\{batch\_prefix}\_{case}).
4. Create a batch file of execution statements for each case: (\runs\{batch\_prefix}\_{case}\call\_{batch\_prefix}\_{case}.bat)
5. All files from &quot;filesforbatch.csv&quot; are copied to &quot;\runs\{batch\_prefix}\_{case}\ &quot;
    * Any files from the root of the repository will be copied to &quot;\runs\{batch\_prefix}\_{case}\ &quot;
    * Any files from &quot;\inputs\ &quot; will be copied to &quot;\runs\{batch\_prefix}\_{case}\inputs\_case\ &quot;
6. Execute the batch file for each case in a new, case-specific window. This window will close when the case is finished. GAMS will produced files unique to each case that can help the user with error debugging:
    * **GAMS Log File**
      * Path: &quot;\runs\{batch\_prefix}\_{case}\gamslog.txt &quot;
      * Purpose: contains the log outputs for all execution statements from the case batch file
      * **SUGGESTION** : This is a good place to check in which execution step errors may have occurred.
    * **GAMS listing files (\*.lst)**
      * Path: &quot;\runs\{batch\_prefix}\_{case}\lstfiles\ &quot;
      * Purpose: contains the listing files for GAMS executions

## Modules

The ReEDS model is comprised of several modules with one and two-way data exchange between the modules. [Figure 22](#Fig22) depicts these modules, including linkages between the modules and directions of data exchange. The supply module is the core module for ReEDS. Within a ReEDS execution, the key data exchanges occur between (1) the Supply Module and the Variable Resource Renewable (VRR) Modules for estimating Capacity Credit and Curtailment; and (2) the Supply Module and the Demand Module. These module interactions are dictated by the model execution approach, i.e., _sequential_ solves, _sliding window_ solves, or _intertemporal_ solves. [Figure 23](#Fig23) illustrates the _sequential_ approach; [Figure 24](#Fig24) the sliding window and intertemporal approaches.

## Tracking Capital Stock

Because ReEDS is a long-term capacity planning model, electricity generation capacity (capital stock) must be tracked over time, including initial capacity, new investments, refurbishment investments, lifetime retirements, and endogenous retirements. [Figure 25](#Fig25) depicts time resolution terminology and capital stock terminology. &quot;Historical&quot; years are 2010-2018, inclusive. &quot;Future&quot; years are 2019 and beyond. &quot;Pre-modeled&quot; years are years prior to 2010 and are not represented in the model decision making. &quot;Modeled&quot; years are years beginning in 2010, the first year of the model to the end of the model horizon. Users can specify the frequency of modeled years as depicted in [Figure 26](#Fig26) in &quot;\inputs\user\_input\modeledyears\_default.csv&quot; and the horizon is specified in &quot;cases.csv&quot;.

<a name="Fig25"></a>
![Image of Time and Stock](https://github.com/NREL/ReEDS_OpenAccess/blob/master/images/time-and-stock.jpg)

<a name="Fig26"></a>
![Image of Model Years](https://github.com/NREL/ReEDS_OpenAccess/blob/master/images/model-years.png)   
 
*Figure 26. Depiction of user-specified model years.*

Capital stock added during the model execution is tracked by a vintage classification based on the time frame when the capacity is installed (e.g., capacity installed between 2030 and 2035 could be defined as a vintage class). The user can specify the vintage class resolution by technology type to control the model size (see &quot;\inputs\userinput\ivt.csv&quot;). All capacity of a technology type (e.g., nuclear) within the same vintage class has the same operating characteristics. Regardless of the vintage class, new investments incur capital cost associated with the year that the investment occurs.

Distinction is made between vintage classes for capacity built during the _pre-modeled_ years---i.e., the _initial_ vintage classes---and vintage classes for capacity built during the _modeled_ years, i.e., the _added_ vintage classes, ([Figure 25](#Fig25)). The _initial_ vintage classes are categorized based on plant performance, specifically, heat rate ([Figure 27](#Fig27)). Whereas, _added_ vintage classes are categorized based on when the capacity is installed.

_Initial_ capacity is tracked based on the capacity remaining in each model year after planned retirements have been removed. Planned capacity additions made during _historical modeled_ years, i.e., 2010-2018, are prescribed _exactly_, thus the model must build _exactly_ the prescribed amount. Planned capacity built during _future modeled years_, i.e.,  2019-2050, are prescribed as a _lower bound_ for new investments, thus the model must build _at least_ the prescribed amount ([Figure 25](#Fig25)).

# Frequently Asked Questions

<a name="Fees"></a>
## How much are the GAMS licensing fees?

The GAMS licensing price list is available on the GAMS website ([https://www.gams.com/products/buy-gams/](https://www.gams.com/products/buy-gams/)). Prices listed are &quot;for an unrestricted, perpetual, single named user on a specific platform.&quot; The prices for additional users are a function of the single user price. [Table 2](#Tab2) and [Table 3](#Tab3) below are examples of the pricing for a multi-user licenses for the Base Module and GAMS\CPLEX . **The prices listed in the table are not offical quotes. Please contact GAMS for an offical quote.**

<a name="Tab2"></a>
*Table 2. Example of initial GAMS licensing fees (USD) based on the number of users for a **Standard** License on a single platform (e.g., Windows).*

<a name="Trail"></a>
## Is there a trial version of the GAMS license so that I can test ReEDS?

You _may_ be able to request a temporary evaluation licenses of the GAMS base module and a GAMS\Solver license. Please contact GAMS for more information.

<a name="Hardware"></a>
## What computer hardware is necessary to run ReEDS?

NREL uses Windows servers to execute the ReEDS model. These servers have Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPUs at 2-2.4GHz and 10-14 cores with 160-320GB of RAM. These servers can execute multiple ReEDS cases in parallel.

[Table 4](#Tab4) summarizes RAM usage and total clock time necessary to execute the default ReEDS configuration for the three different solve structures (sequential, window, and intertemporal) using one of these servers.

<a name="Tab4"></a>
*Table 4. Ballpark RAM usage and clock time for select model configurations executed on NREL servers.*

| Solve Structure | Solve Steps | Approximate LP size <br> per instance (after presolve) | Threads | RAM(GB per instance) | Total Clock Time (hours) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sequential | 2010-2030: 2 yr <br> 2031-2050: 5 yr | Rows: 461k <br> Columns: 384k <br> Non-Zeros: 2,042k | 4 | 4-7GB | 3-5 |
| Window | 2010-2030: 2 yr <br> 2031-2050: 5 yr | Rows: 1,143k <br> Columns:869k <br> Non-Zeros: 5,087k | 8 | 14-18GB | 18-22  |
| Intertemporal | 2010-2030: 2 yr <br> 2031-2050: 5 yr | Rows:12,789k <br> Columns: 9,890k <br> Non-Zeros: 61,076k | 12 | 57GB+ | 48-72|

Table Notes:
* Default solve window configuration: 11 windows and 5 iterations per window (see &quot;\inputs\userinput\windows_default.csv&quot;). The problem size is taken from last iteration. The problem size varies by about 5% across iterations.
* Intertemporal: 8-12 hours per iteration, 5-7 iterations total

<a name="Interconnect"></a>
## Can I configure a ReEDS case to run as an isolated interconnect?
Yes, you can configure ReEDS as a single interconnect. Limiting the spatial extent may be beneficial for modeling more difficult instances. 

**WARNING!:** The default case configurations were designed for modeling the lower 48 United States. Therefore, the user should be aware of possible issues with executing an interconnect in isolation, including but not limited to the following:

* Natural gas prices are based on either national or census division supply curves. The natural gas prices are computed as a function of the quantity consumed relative to a reference quantity. Consuming less than the reference quantity drives the price downward; consuming more drives the price upward. When modeling a single interconnection, the user should either modify the reference gas quantity to account for a smaller spatial extent or use fixed gas prices in every census division (i.e., case configuration option [GSw\_GasCurve](#SwOther) = 2). For example, if we execute ERCOT in isolation using census division supply curves, we may want to reduce the reference gas quantity for the West South Central (WSC) census division which includes Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana. Or we could assume the gas price in the WSC region is fixed.

* Infeasibilities may arise in state-level constraints when only part of a state is represented in an interconnect. For example, the Western interconnection includes a small portion of Texas (El Paso). State-level constraints will be enforced for Texas, but El Paso may not be able to meet the requirement for all of Texas.

* Certain constraints may not apply in every interconnect. Some examples include: 
  * California State RPS REC trading constraints only apply to the West
  * CAIR and CSAPR only apply to certain states, so the emission limits may need to be adjusted
  * RGGI only applies to a subset of states in the northeast 
  * California policies (e.g., SB32, California Storage Mandate) only apply to California
