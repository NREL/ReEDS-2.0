# ReEDS 2.0
## Welcome to the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) Model!

This GitHub repository contains the source code for NREL&#39;s ReEDS model. The ReEDS model source code is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The ReEDS model can be downloaded or cloned from [https://github.com/NREL/ReEDS-2.0](https://github.com/NREL/ReEDS-2.0). 

**For more information about the model, see the [open source ReEDS-2.0 Documentation](https://nrel.github.io/ReEDS-2.0)**

A ReEDS training video (based on the 2020 version of ReEDS) is available on the NREL YouTube channel at [https://youtu.be/aGj3Jnspk9M?si=iqCRNn5MbGZc8ZIO](https://youtu.be/aGj3Jnspk9M?si=iqCRNn5MbGZc8ZIO).

# Introduction ([https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/](https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/)) 

The Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) is a capacity planning and dispatch model for the North American electricity system.

As NREL&#39;s flagship long-term power sector model, ReEDS has served as the primary analytic tool for many studies ([https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/publications.html](https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/publications.html)) of important energy sector research questions, including clean energy policy, renewable grid integration, technology innovation, and forward-looking issues of the generation and transmission infrastructure. Data from the most recent base case and a suite of Standard Scenarios are provided.

ReEDS uses high spatial resolution and high-fidelity modeling. Though it covers a broad geographic and technological scope, ReEDS is designed to reflect the regional attributes of energy production and consumption. Unique among long-term capacity expansion models, ReEDS possesses advanced algorithms and data to represent the cost and value of variable renewable energy; the full suite of other major generation technologies, including fossil and nuclear; and transmission and storage expansion options. Used in combination with other NREL tools, data, and expertise, ReEDS can provide objective and comprehensive electricity system futures.

# Required Software

The ReEDS model is written primarily in GAMS with auxiliary modules written in Python. R is used for the demand module, which is not active by default, and therefore need not be installed unless you plan on working with that module. At present, NREL uses the following software versions: GAMS 30.3; Python 3.6.5; R 3.4.4. Other versions of these software may be compatible with ReEDS, but NREL has not tested other versions at this time.

GAMS is a mathematical programming software from the GAMS Development Corporation. &quot;The use of GAMS beyond the limits of the free demo system requires the presence of a valid GAMS license file.&quot; [[1](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_License.html)] The ReEDS model requires the GAMS Base Module and a linear programming (LP) solver (e.g., CPLEX). The LP solver should be connected to GAMS with either a GAMS/Solver license or a GAMS/Solver-Link license. &quot;A GAMS/Solver connects the GAMS Base module to a particular solver and includes a license for this solver to be used through GAMS. It is not necessary to install additional software. A GAMS/Solver-Link connects the GAMS Base Module to a particular solver, but does not include a license for the solver. It may be necessary to install additional software before the solver can be used.&quot; [[2](https://www.gams.com/products/buy-gams/)]

NREL subscribes to the GAMS/CPLEX license for the LP solver, but open-source solvers and free, internet-based services are also available. 
* The [_COIN-OR Optimization Suite_](https://www.coin-or.org/downloading/) includes open-source solvers that can be linked with GAMS through the GAMS Base Module. NREL has tested the use of the COIN-OR Linear Programming (CLP) solver for ReEDS. More information about using CLP for ReEDS can be found [_here_](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/77907.pdf). 
* The [_NEOS Server_](https://neos-server.org/neos/) is a free, internet-based service for solving numerical optimization problems. Links with NEOS can be made through [_KESTREL_](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/S_KESTREL.html) which is included in GAMS Base Module. In its current form, ReEDS cannot be solved using NEOS due to the 16 MB limit on submissions to the server. However, modifications _could_ be made to ReEDS to _potentially_ reduce the data below to the required submission size. Note that some solvers available on the NEOS server are limited to non-commercial use. 

Python is &quot;an object-oriented programming language, comparable to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, or Java.&quot; [[3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Overview)] &quot; Python is developed under an OSI-approved open source license, making it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use. Python&#39;s license is administered by the Python Software Foundation.&quot; [[4](https://www.python.org/about/)]. NREL uses Conda to build the python environment necessary for ReEDS. Conda is a &quot;package, dependency and environment management for any language.&quot; [[5](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)]

Git is a version-control tool used to manage code repositories. Included in Git is a unix style command line emulator called Git Bash, which is used by ReEDS to perform some initial setup tasks.
