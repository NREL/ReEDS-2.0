# Introduction ([https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/](https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/)) 

The Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) India is a capacity planning and dispatch model for the North American electricity system.

As NREL&#39;s flagship long-term power sector model, ReEDS has served as the primary analytic tool for many studies ([https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/publications.html](https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/publications.html)) of important energy sector research questions, including clean energy policy, renewable grid integration, technology innovation, and forward-looking issues of the generation and transmission infrastructure. The ReEDS India model extends this capability to investigate critical power sector question for India

ReEDS uses high spatial resolution and high-fidelity modeling. Though it covers a broad geographic and technological scope, ReEDS is designed to reflect the regional attributes of energy production and consumption. Unique among long-term capacity expansion models, ReEDS possesses advanced algorithms and data to represent the cost and value of variable renewable energy; the full suite of other major generation technologies, including fossil and nuclear; and transmission and storage expansion options. Used in combination with other NREL tools, data, and expertise, ReEDS can provide objective and comprehensive electricity system futures.

<a name="Software"></a>
# Required Software
 
 The ReEDS model is written primarily in GAMS with auxiliary modules written in Python and R. At present, NREL uses the following software versions: GAMS 24.7.4; Python 3.6.5; R 3.4.4;. Other versions of these software may be compatible with ReEDS, but NREL has not tested other versions at this time.

GAMS is a mathematical programming software from the GAMS Development Corporation. &quot;The use of GAMS beyond the limits of the free demo system requires the presence of a valid GAMS license file.&quot; [[1](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_License.html)] The ReEDS model requires the GAMS Base Module and a linear programming (LP) solver (e.g., CPLEX). The LP solver should be connected to GAMS with either a GAMS/Solver license or a GAMS/Solver-Link license. &quot;A GAMS/Solver connects the GAMS Base module to a particular solver and includes a license for this solver to be used through GAMS. It is not necessary to install additional software. A GAMS/Solver-Link connects the GAMS Base Module to a particular solver, but does not include a license for the solver. It may be necessary to install additional software before the solver can be used.&quot; [[2](https://www.gams.com/products/buy-gams/)]

NREL subscribes to the GAMS/CPLEX license for the LP solver, but open-source and free, internet-based services are also available. The [_COIN-OR Optimization Suite_](https://www.coin-or.org/downloading/) includes open-source solvers that can be linked with GAMS through the GAMS Base Module. NREL has not tested the performance of these open-source solvers for ReEDS. The [_NEOS Server_](https://neos-server.org/neos/) is a free, internet-based service for solving numerical optimization problems. Links with NEOS can be made through [_KESTREL_](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/S_KESTREL.html) which is included in GAMS Base Module. In its current form, ReEDS cannot be solved using NEOS due to the 16 MB limit on submissions to the server. However, modifications _could_ be made to ReEDS to _potentially_ reduce the data below to the required submission size.

Python is &quot;an object-oriented programming language, comparable to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, or Java.&quot; [[3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Overview)] &quot; Python is developed under an OSI-approved open source license, making it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use. Python&#39;s license is administered by the Python Software Foundation.&quot; [[4](https://www.python.org/about/)]. NREL uses Conda to build the python environment necessary for ReEDS. Conda is a &quot;package, dependency and environment management for any language.&quot; [[5](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)]

&quot;R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics…R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation&#39;s GNU General Public License in source code form.&quot; [[6](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)]

<a name="Setup"></a>
# Setting up your computer to run ReEDS for the first time (for Microsoft Windows 10)

The setup and execution of the ReEDS model can be accomplished using a command-line interpreter application and launching a command line interface (referred to as a &quot;terminal window&quot; in this document). For example, initiating the Windows Command Prompt application, i.e., cmd.exe, will launch a terminal window ([Figure 1](#Fig1)).

<a name="Fig1"></a>
![Image of Command Prompt](https://github.nrel.gov/ReEDS/ReEDS-2.0/blob/master/images/cmd-prompt.png)

*Figure 1. Screenshot of a Windows Command Prompt terminal window.*

While these installation instructions are specific to Windows 10, this version of ReEDS India has been tested to be compatible with MacOS High Sierra 10.12 as well as Linux CentOX 7.4 operating systems.

**SUGGESTON:** use a command line emulator such as ConEmu ([https://conemu.github.io/](https://conemu.github.io/)) for a more user-friendly terminal. The screenshots of terminal windows shown in this document are taken using ConEmu.

**IMPORTANT:** Users should exercise Administrative Privileges when installing software. For example, right click on the installer executable for one of the required software (e.g., Anaconda3-2019.07-Windows-x86\_64.exe) and click on &quot;Run as administrator&quot; ([Figure 2](#Fig2)). Alternatively, right click on the executable for the command line interface (e.g., Command Prompt) and click on &quot;Run as administrator&quot; ([Figure 3](#Fig3)). Then run the required software installer executables from the command line.

<a name="Execution"></a>
# Executing the Model

The execution of the ReEDS India model can be accomplished by using a command-line interpreter application and launching a command line interface.

A ReEDS India scenario (also referred to as a &quot;run&quot;, &quot;case&quot; or &quot;instance&quot;) is executed through a python-based case batching program called &quot;runmodel.py&quot;. The user can execute a single case or a batch of cases using this program.

**Step 1** : Specify the ReEDS scenario name(s) and configuration(s) in the case configuration file.([Figure 12](#Fig12)). 

The scenario configuration file name is called &quot;cases.csv&quot; in the &quot;A_Inputs&quot; folder. Within &quot;cases.csv&quot;, the data in Column A are the model &quot;switches&quot; (also referred to as &quot;options&quot;). Column B provides brief descriptions of the switches. The data in Column C are the default values of the switches. Every subsequent column represents an individual model scenario, beginning with Column D. The scenario name is specified in Row 1. The value for each switch is specified beginning in Row 2. If a switch value is left blank, the default value from Column C is used. Users can tailor the default scenarios in two ways: 1.) adjust the default switch values for an existing scenario or 2.) create a new scenario by adding a new column with a scenario name in Row 1 and desired switch values beginning in Row 2.

A complete list of switches is provided in the Appendix of this document.

![Image of Cases.csv](https://github.nrel.gov/ReEDS/ReEDS-2.0/blob/India_Public/images/cases.jpg) 

*Figure 12. Screenshot of cases.csv.*

**Step 2** : Compile and run the model from the command line

1. Initiate a command-line interpreter application and launch a command line interface.
2.	Navigate to the ReEDS India model directory in the command line.
3.	Enter 
	> python runmodel.py

in the command line and press &quot;Enter/Return&quot; to initiate the ReEDS India model

4.	You will then be asked to name the model run. Enter a name using valid characters and press return: 

	> Specify the name of the run(s)
	
	> Run Name (default is a timestamp): testrun

5.	Next, you will be asked which scenario you would like to run. This list is generated from the column headers in &quot;cases.csv&quot;. By default, the following options are available. 
Please select which scenarios you would like to run
Enter each selected number separated by a comma (i.e. 1, 3)

> -----------------------------------------------------------

> 0 -- Base

> 1 -- CoalFlex

> 2 -- FlatLoad

> 3 -- LowLoad

> 4 -- LowSolarCost

> 5 -- NewGas

> 6 –- LowBatCost

> 7 -- toy

> 8 -- RUN ALL

> Selected scenarios (default 8): 0,4,6

6.	Next, you will be asked if you want to use capacity credit and curtailment capabilities in ReEDS. These modules use the investment and generation outputs from ReEDS and calculate capacity credit and curtailment for variable generation and storage technologies. The results are fed back into the ReEDS model to adjust the variable decisions. The number of iterations between the ReEDS optimization problem and capacity credit and curtailment calculations is defined in &quot;cases.csv&quot;. 

> Do you want to iteratively calculate capacity value and curtailment? (0=no / 1=yes, default 1): 0

7.	Select whether you wish to compile a model, which will execute scripts contained in the 'A_Inputs' and 'B_Equations' modules of ReEDS. This option should almost always be selected, unless you are attempting to run a previously compiled model. 

> Compile inputs and model equations? (0=no / 1=yes, default 1): 1

8.	Select whether you want to run the model, which will execute scripts contained in the 'C_Solve', 'D_8760' and 'E_Outputs' modules of ReEDS. Only select this option if you are on the computer which you wish to run ReEDS on. By default, this will run the selected scenarios in cases.csv sequentially. If you wish to model scenarios in parallel and have available computational resources (such as a High Performance Computing system), you might be better off selecting '0' at this point, as you should then be asked if you want to create batch files capable of simultaneously running multiple cases. 

> Run model? (0=no / 1=yes, default 1): 1

9.	Finally, choose to compile an R Markdown html file after model completion, with sophisticated visualizations comparing your model results across several temporal and geospatial plots. This requires a proper installation of R available in the system path, along with the 'pacman' R package installed.

> Generate R Markdown for visualization after scenario run? (0=no / 1=yes, default 1): 1

10.	Once all responses are received, the batching program will execute the scenario(s) specified. Each scenario selected to run now has a folder in &quotE_Outputs/runs/&quot; containing two .bat files:
	* &quot;compile_{runname}_{scenarioname}.bat&quot;
	* &quot;run_{runname}_{scenarioname}.bat&quot;

Either of these files can be manually executed in order to compile or run specific modules of ReEDS from outside the command line interface prompt. Either step can be executed by double clicking on the appropriate .bat file in &quot;E_Outputs/runs/&quot;. 
> E_Outputs/runs/testrun_Base/compile_testrun_Base.bat

compile the model (evaluate A_Inputs and B_Equations)

> E_Outputs/runs/testrun_Base/run_testrun_Base.bat

solve the model, requires that a model has already been compiled


**Step 3** : Wait for each case to finish, check for successful completion, and view outputs. 
Following a successful run, a .gdx file with all model results will be stored in &quot;E_Outputs/gdxfiles/output_{runname}_{scenarioname}.gdx&quot;. If R is correctly installed, a standard .html visualization report will automatically open and is also stored in &quot;F_Analysis&quot;



<a name="Debug"></a>
# Debugging Tips

GAMS will produced files unique to each case that can help the user with error debugging:
1. **GAMS Log File**
  * Path: &quot;E_Outputs\runs\{runname}_{scenarioname}\gamslog.txt&quot;
  * Purpose: contains the log outputs for all execution statements from the case batch file
  * **SUGGESTION** : This is a good place to check in which execution step errors may have occurred.
2. **GAMS listing files (\*.lst)**
  * Path: &quot;E_Outputs\\runs\{runname}_{scenarioname}\lstfiles\ &quot;
  * Purpose: contains the listing files for GAMS executions
  * **SUGGESTION** : This is a good place to check in which line of the source code errors may have occurred
3. **GAMS workfile (\*.g00)**
  * Path: &quot;E_Outputs\runs{runname}_{scenarioname}\g00files\ &quot;
  * Purpose: stores a snapshot all the model information available to GAMS at that point in the case execution.
  * For more information about GAMS work files: [https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG\_SaveRestart.html](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_SaveRestart.html)
  * **SUGGESTION** : A failed case can be restarted from this snapshot point. The user can rerun the batch file for the case (E_Outputs\runs\{runname}_{scenarioname}\run_{runname}_{scenarioname}.bat) after commenting out a execution statements that completed successfully.

## Is there a trial version of the GAMS license so that I can test ReEDS?

You _may_ be able to request a temporary evaluation licenses of the GAMS base module and a GAMS\Solver license. Please contact GAMS for more information.

## What computer hardware is necessary to run ReEDS?

NREL uses Windows servers to execute the ReEDS model. These servers have Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPUs at 2-2.4GHz and 10-14 cores with 160-320GB of RAM. These servers can execute multiple ReEDS cases in parallel.

[Table 5](#Tab5) summarizes RAM usage and total clock time necessary to execute the default ReEDS configuration for the three different solve structures (sequential, window, and intertemporal) using one of these servers.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Intertemporal | 10 sample years 2017-2047 | Rows:1,832k <br> Columns: 837k <br> Non-Zeros: 7,637k | 8 | 5GB+ | 40-60|

## Can I adjust the model input parameters or constraints?

You may update some of the model inputs or constraints to reflect your own data or research questions. Some updates may be simple (e.g., change the values in one input csv to test different technology costs) while others may require advanced knowledge of GAMS (e.g., adding a new constraint).
