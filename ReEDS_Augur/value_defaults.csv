key,value,dtype,description
condor_discharge_eff,1,float,discharging efficiency used in Condor
condor_keep_techs,"GAS,COAL",list,technologies considered in Condor
condor_res,50,int,resolution of the dispatch algorithm in Condor (default: 50)- determines the number of discrete values that marginal storage's energy capacity is broken up into for the dynamic program. Higher=slower and more accurate. Don't set below 20
condor_res_method,equal,str,"condor resolution method (equal, scaled) (default: equal) - equal: each storage tech uses condor_res (default: 50); scaled: battery_2 uses condor_res (default 15), remaining storage techs have increasing Condor resolution scaled by their duration."
