'''
This script takes in raw marginal damage estimates from the reduced complexity models
and processes them for use in ReEDS in calculating health damages, namely converting
from county to ReEDS BA. 

This script only needs to be once when new marginal damage data is downloaded.

Marginal damage data and documentation available from https://www.caces.us/data.
