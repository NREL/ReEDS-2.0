## Temporal resolution

### Temporal resolution switches

- `GSw_HourlyNumClusters` specifies the maximum number of representative periods.
- Two other switches, `GSw_HourlyPeakLevel` and `GSw_HourlyMinRElevel`, indicate additional "outlying periods" that can be added (peak-load-containing periods for `GSw_HourlyPeakLevel`, minimum-average-PV-CF and minimum-average-wind-CF periods for `GSw_HourlyMinRElevel`). If running the US and both are set to "interconnect", they add the 3 peak-load days, 3 minimum-wind days, and 3 minimum-PV days by interconnect, resulting in 33+9=42 by default if `GSw_HourlyNumClusters`=33. These "outlying periods" are only included when using capacity credit (`GSw_PRM_CapCredit=1`) instead of stress periods (`GSw_PRM_CapCredit=0`).
- When using `GSw_HourlyClusterAlgorithm=optimized` (the default), then depending on the setting of `GSw_HourlyClusterRegionLevel` there will be a maximum number of days it needs to reproduce the distribution of load/pv/wind. When `GSw_HourlyClusterRegionLevel=transreg` (the default), there are 11 regions and 3 features, so it needs ~33 days to reproduce the distribution (like an eigenvalue problem).
  - So turning up `GSw_HourlyNumClusters` on its own won't increase the temporal coverage. If you want more temporal coverage, the options are:
    - Switch to `GSw_HourlyType=wek`, which increases the length of the periods from 1 day to 5 days. If all the other switches are left at their defaults, switching to `wek` would increase the coverage from 42 days to 5*42=210 days.
    - Reduce `GSw_HourlyClusterRegionLevel` to something smaller than transreg (like `st`), and then increase `GSw_HourlyNumClusters`
    - Switch to `GSw_HourlyClusteAlgorithm=hierarchical` and then increase `GSw_HourlyNumClusters` (although that's less desirable, because hierarchical clustering doesn't do as good of a job of reproducing the actual spatial distribution of CF and load)
    - Switch to `Gsw_HourlyType=year`. Although if you're running for the whole US you'll need to turn on region aggregation (`GSw_RegionResolution=aggreg` and `GSw_HierarchyFile` in [`default` or `agg1`, or `agg2` or `agg3`]) for it to solve.
- `GSw_HourlyClusterAlgorithm`
  - If set to 'hierarchical', then hierarchical clustering is used via

  ```python
  sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering(
      n_clusters=int(sw['GSw_HourlyNumClusters']),
      affinity='euclidean', linkage='ward')
  ```

  - If set to 'optimized', then a two-step custom optimization is performed using the `hourly_repperiods.optimize_period_weights()` and `hourly_repperiods.assign_representative_days()` functions to minimize the deviation in regional load and PV/wind CF between the weighted representative periods and the full year.
  - If set to a string containing the substring 'user', then instead of optimizing the choice of representative periods for this run, we read them from the inputs/variability/period_szn_user.csv file.
    - The scenario name is in the first column, labeled 'scenario'. ReEDS will use rows with the same label as `GSw_HourlyClusterAlgorithm`.
      - So if you want to use the example period:szn map, just set `GSw_HourlyClusterAlgorithm=user`.
      - If you want to specify a different period:szn map, then add your mapping at the bottom of inputs/variability/period_szn_user.csv with a unique scenario name in the 'scenario' column, and set `GSw_HourlyClusterAlgorithm` to your unique scenario name, *which must contain the substring 'user'*. (For example, I could use a mapping called 'user_myname_20230130' by adding my period:szn map to inputs/variability/period_szn_user.csv with 'user_myname_20230130' in the 'scenario' column and setting `GSw_HourlyClusterAlgorithm=user_myname_20230130`.)
      - Make sure the settings for `GSw_HourlyType` and `GSw_HourlyWeatherYears` match your user-defined map. For example, if your 'user_myname_20230130' map includes 365 representative days for weather year 2012, then set `GSw_HourlyType=day` and `GSw_HourlyWeatherYears=2012`.
      - You can feed the period:szn mapping from a completed run into the inputs folder of your repo to force ReEDS to use the same representative or stress periods. More detail can be found [here](https://pages.github.nrel.gov/ReEDS/ReEDS-2.0/postprocessing_tools.html#fix-representative-stress-periods-preprocessing-get-case-periods-py) 

- `GSw_PRM_StressThreshold`: The default setting of 'transgrp_10_EUE_sum' means a threshold of "**10** ppm NEUE in each **transgrp**", with stress periods selected by the daily **sum** of **EUE** within each **transgrp**.
  - The first argument can be selected from ['country', 'interconnect', 'nercr', 'transreg', 'transgrp', 'st', 'r'] and specifies the hierarchy level within which to compare RA performance against the threshold.
  - The second argument can be any float and specifies the RA performance threshold in parts per million [ppm].
  - The third argument can be 'NEUE' or 'EUE', specifying which metric to use when selecting stress periods. If set to 'NEUE' the model will add stress periods with the largest **fraction** of dropped load; if set to 'EUE' the model will add stress periods with the largest **absolute MWh** of dropped load.
  - The fourth argument can be 'sum' or 'max', specifying whether to add stress periods in order of their daily per-hour max dropped load or by their daily sum of dropped load when selecting stress periods.
  - If desired you can provide /-delimited entries like 'transgrp_10_EUE_sum/country_1_EUE_sum', meaning that each transgrp must have ≤10 ppm NEUE and the country overall must have ≤1 ppm NEUE.


### Conventions

- Timestamps are formatted as `y{year}d{day of year}h{hour of day}` in hour-ending format in Eastern Standard Time. The numbering of days begins at 1. For example, the hour from 3am-4am on January 3, 2012 would be indicated as `y2012d003h004`.
  - When using representative weks (5-day periods), timestamps are instead formatted as `y{year}w{wek of year}h{hour of wek}`. The numbering of weks begins at 1. In this format, the hour from 3am-4am on January 3, 2012 would be indicated as `y2012w001h052`.
- Representative and stress **periods** (indexed as `szn` within ReEDS) are labeled similarly to timestamps but without the `h{hour of day}` component...
  - *Except stress periods and stress timeslices have an 's' prefix.* So if the time period above showed up as a stress period, it would be labeled as `h=sy2012d003h004` and `szn=sy2012d003` for represntative days (or `h=sy2012w001h052` and `szn=sy2012w001` for representative weks). Stress periods are modeled using different loads and transmission capacities than representative periods, so they need to be indexed separately.



## Hourly Resolution
The model can be run at hourly resolution using the following switch settings:
* `GSw_Hourly = 1`
  * Turn on hourly resolution
* `GSw_Canada = 2`
  * Turn on hourly resolution for Canadian imports/exports
* `GSw_AugurCurtailment = 0`
  * Turn off the Augur calculation of curtailment
* `GSw_StorageArbitrageMult = 0`
  * Turn off the Augur calculation of storage arbitrage value
* `GSw_Storage_in_Min = 0`
  * Turn off the Augur calculation of storage charging
* `capcredit_szn_hours = 3`
  * The current default hourly representation is 18 representative 5-day weeks. Each representative period is treated as a 'season' and is thus active in the planning-reserve margin constraint. In h17 ReEDS we set `capcredit_szn_hours = 10`, giving 40 total hours considered for planning reserves (the top 10 hours in each of the 4 quarterly seasons). 18 'seasons' with 10 hours each would give 180 hours, so we switch to 3 hours per 'season' (for 54 hours total).

To further reduce solve time, you can make the following changes:
* `yearset_suffix = fiveyear`
  * Solve in 5-year steps
* `GSw_OpRes = 0`
  * Turn off operating reserves
* `GSw_MinLoading = 0`
  * Turn off the sliding-window representation of minimum-generation limits
* `GSw_PVB = 0`
  * Turn off PV-battery hybrids
* `GSw_calc_powfrac = 0`
  * Turn off a post-processing calculation of power flows

### Resources for more info about ReEDS's load profiles

- [Standard Scenarios 2024](https://docs.nrel.gov/docs/fy25osti/92256.pdf) has a appendix that synthesizes what is included in these demand profiles in more detail. See pg 37-45 for more information. Note that this describes the previous batch of EER profiles from June 2023; however, the high level trends will be largely consistent between the previous and current profiles.  
- [ADP 2024's Technical Documentation](https://www.evolved.energy/us-adp-2024) lists many of their underlying stock assumptions.
- [EER's docs page](https://energypathways.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) if you want a deeper look into their modeling.


### Different weather years

For EER’s load profiles, “weather” includes everything considered by NREL's [ResStock](https://resstock.nrel.gov/) and [ComStock](https://comstock.nrel.gov/) building models (i.e., temperature, humidity, insolation, and wind speed). This information gets translated into variations in load through regressions and benchmarking with historical system load data for the weather year in question.

### Demand Response

Demand response is turned off by default. To enable it the following switches are needed:
  - `GSw_DRShed`: turns on/off the demand response resource
  - `GSw_MaxDailyCF` : turns on/off daily maximum capacity factor constraint
  - `dr_shedscen`: scenario to define which scalars will be used for the supply curve cost and capacity

## Hydrogen inputs

Most hydrogen input files are in the `inputs/consume/` folder.

### consume_char_[GSw_H2_Inputs].csv

Contains cost and performance assumption for electrolyzers and steam-methane reformer.

Electrolyzer capital cost assumptions are based on the Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Clean Hydrogen Report (<https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20230320-Liftoff-Clean-H2-vPUB-0329-update.pdf>) [see values in the footnotes of Figure 3 on page 14].
The reference scenario assumes linearly decline from 1750 $/kW in 2022 to 550 $/kW in 2030, and then remain constant after.
The low cost scenario assumes further declines from 2030 to 2050.

Fixed O&M values are assumed to be 5% of CAPEX (source: <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acacb5>)

Electrolyzer performance (efficiency) as well as SMR cost and performance assumptions are derived from assumptions H2A: Hydrogen Analysis Production Models (<https://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/h2a-production-models.html>), with guidance from Paige Jadun.
See original input assumptions in the ReEDS-2.0_Input_Processing repo: <https://github.nrel.gov/ReEDS/ReEDS-2.0_Input_Processing/blob/main/H2/costs/H2ProductionCosts-20210414.xlsx>.

Note that SMR costs are currently in 2018$ and electrolyzer costs are in 2022$.

### h2_transport_and_storage_costs.csv

| Investment    | Cost type | Units |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Pipelines  | Overnight Capital Cost  | $/[(metric ton/hour)*mile] |
| Pipelines  | FOM  | $/[(metric ton/hour)*mile*year] |
| Pipelines  | Electric load | MWh/metric ton |
| Compressors  | Overnight Capital Cost  | $/(metric ton-hour) |
| Compressors  | FOM  | $/[(metric ton/hour)*year) |
| Compressors  | Electric load  | MWh/metric ton |
| Storage  | Overnight Capital Cost  | $/metric ton |
| Storage  | FOM  | $/(metric ton*year) |
| Storage  | Electric load  | MWh/metric ton |

The values in `H2_transport_and_storage_costs.csv` are based on raw data provided from the SERA model by Paige Jadun.
The raw data are formated by the `process-h2-inputs.py` script in the input processing repository (<https://github.nrel.gov/ReEDS/ReEDS-2.0_Input_Processing/blob/main/H2/process-h2-inputs.py>).

### Intra-Regional Hydrogen Transport Cost

Flat cost for intra-ReEDS BA hydrogen transport and storage in $/kg H2 produced.
Specified via `GSw_H2_IntraReg_Transport`.
Default value assumes transport via pipelines and is from [2023 DOE Clean Hydrogen Liftoff Report](https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20230523-Pathways-to-Commercial-Liftoff-Clean-Hydrogen.pdf) pg 15.
Transport costs could be more expensive if you assume other methods of H2 transport (ex. trucking).

Note: this cost is only assessed for new plants (those that fall in the `newv(v)` set), not existing H2 producers.
This is because existing hydrogen plants likely have already installed the necessary infrastructure to connect to a hydrogen demand center (likely an industrial plant) and that infrastructure was likely sized appropriately for the consumers needs.
Therefore, that H2 producer shouldn't pay an additional investment cost for intra-regional hydrogen transport since they will not be transporting hydrogen elsewhere.
However, new hydrogen producing plants, especially in a decarbonized power system or if a large hydrogen economy manifests, might not be physically close to the hydrogen consumers and therefore should pay this cost.

### h2_storage_rb.csv

Mapping of ReEDS balancing are to available H2 storage type.
Since costs are always ordered (saltcavern < hardrock < above ground), BAs with access to saltcaverns or hardrock storage are only assigned to the cheapest option to reduce the model size.

### Retail adder for electrolytic load

- One option for the retail adder for electrolytic load (`GSw_RetailAdder`) is derived from the difference between the industrial average rate and the ReEDS wholesale cost. The calculation below is done in 2023 dollars:
  - National average energy price paid in 2023 by industrial consumers (via EIA 861, <https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861m/> --> sales and revenue --> download data. This value is the sales weighted average): $80.55/MWh
  - ReEDS average wholesale cost from 2023 Standard Scenarios Mid-case in model 2026 (since we cannot find quality empirical wholesale prices): $41.78/MWh
  - Difference between the industrial average rate and the wholesale cost: $39/MWh
  - Deflated to 2004 dollars: $28/MWh

Note: please be aware that ReEDS's solutions are very sensitive to this switch.
With `GSw_RetailAdder=28`, there is very little to no electrolytic hydrogen.
With `GSw_RetailAdder=0` and with exogenous H2 demand, you may see nearly all of the exogenous H2 demand profile being met by electrolyzers and/or a large endogenous H2 economy.

### Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (45V)

#### The regulation itself

The hydrogen production tax credit was enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.
It is commonly referred to as 45V due to the section of the tax code it is in.
It provides up to $3 per kg of H2 produced (2022 USD, credit amount is [inflation adjusted in subsequent years](https://www.taxnotes.com/research/federal/irs-guidance/notices/irs-releases-clean-hydrogen-credit-inflation-adjustment/7kd80)), based on the lifecycle emissions of hydrogen production as shown in the table below.
These lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions only includes emissions only through the point of production (i.e. does not include hydrogen transport or storage).

Since the largest component of the lifecycle emissions of electrolytic hydrogen production is the carbon intensity of the generators powering the electrolyzer, the main point of contention for this regulation has been how to define the carbon intensity of electricity.
The Department of the Treasury proposed [guidance](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/26/2023-28359/section-45v-credit-for-production-of-clean-hydrogen-section-48a15-election-to-treat-clean-hydrogen) on December 22, 2023 stating the requirements for demonstrating the CO2 intensity of H2 production and published their [final rules](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-31513/credit-for-production-of-clean-hydrogen-and-energy-credit) on January 3, 2025.
This press release has a nice [summary](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2768).

| Life-cycle Emissions (kg CO2-e / kg H2) | PTC (2022$ / kg H2) | CO2 intensity of electricity to meet incentive required through electrolysis (tonnes CO2 / MWh) |
| --------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| [4, 2.5]  | 0.6 | [.07, .045] |
| (2.5, 1.5] | 0.75 | (.045, .027]  |
| (1.5, 0.45] | 1 | (.027, .007] |
| (0.45, 0] | 3 | (.008, 0] |

To ensure the low carbon intensity of the electricity powering electrolyzers, the hydrogen production tax credit has three "pillars" or core components, as described below:  

1. Incrementality (also referred to as additionality): generators must have a commercial online date no more than three years before a H2 production facility's placed in service date to qualify.
Example: if an electrolyzer is put in service in 2028, only generators whose commercial operations dates are between 2025-2028 may qualify to power this electrolyzer.
This requirement starts immediately. There are special exceptions for nuclear, CCS and states with robust GHG emission caps - we do not model these additional pathways in ReEDS.
2. Hourly matching: each MWh must be consumed by an electrolyzer in the same hour of the year in which it was generated.
3. Deliverablity: each MWh must be consumed by an electrolyzer in the same region in which it was generated. Regional matching is required at the National Transmission Needs Study region level, as shown in the image below.

These three pillars are combined differently depending on which year it is:

- 2024-2029: annual matching, regional matching, additionality required
- 2030 onwards: hourly matching, regional matching, additionality required

Please see the Department of the Treasury [final rules](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-31513/credit-for-production-of-clean-hydrogen-and-energy-credit) if you want to learn more.

##### How is this regulated?

There will be a system of trading credits, which are called Energy Attribute Credit (EACs).
This is similar to Renewable Energy Credits (RECs).
Qualifying clean technologies produce EACs which are tracked by region, vintage (commercial online year), and hour in which they are produced.
Electrolyzers must purchase and retire EACs for all MWh used in order to receive the 45V credit.

##### Which generating technologies qualify to produce Energy Attribute Credits?

The law is technology neutral and does not stipulate which technologies can or cannot produce an EAC, it only specifies the lifecycle emissions of hydrogen production, which is calculated by the [GREET Model](https://www.anl.gov/topic/greet) out of Argonne National Lab.
This model considers the carbon intensity of the electricity from various sources.
You can reverse calculate the range of CO2 intensity of electricity required to meet the various incentive levels (assuming H2 production via electrolysis).
These are the values in the 3rd column of the table above.
Based on their low CO2 emissions, qualifying clean technologies could include: wind, solar PV, nuclear, gas with CCS, geothermal and hydropower.

##### What years does the hydrogen production tax credit apply to?

The hydrogen production tax credit took effect immediately, so in 2023.
Projects must begin construction by 2033.
The credit can be received for 10 years.
Therefore, the latest we would see plants receiving 45V through 2042.
If the final regulations include a 4-hr year safe harbor (consistent with other tax credits such as the PTC and ITC), then projects receiving 45V could consutrction as late as by 2037 and receive 45V through 2046.

##### Intersection with other tax credits and policies

- Section 45Y PTC and Section 48E ITC
  - 45V can be stacked with the PTC/ITC.
  This is because it is two different plants which are claiming the credit.
  Example: a wind plant could produce a MWh of energy and receive the generation PTC for that energy produced.
  That energy could power an electrolyzer which could then receive 45V.
- Section 45Q - carbon capture and sequestration
  - The same plant cannot claim both 45Q and 45V.
  So for example, an SMR-CCS plant cannot claim both 45Q for their carbon capture and 45V for their hydrogen production.
  They must choose one.
  We calculated that 45Q will be most valuable for most SMR-CCS plants and therefore assume that they take that in the model.
  - However, a gas-CCS plant could produce a MWh of energy and receive 45Q for that energy produced.
  Since they are a relative clean generator per their lifecycle emissions, this energy produces a EAC.
  So the gas-CCS plant would receive 45Q and the electrolyzer would receive 45V.
  People frequently confuse this.
  Only the hydrogen producer receives 45V.
  Generating technologies are merely creating the Energy Attribute Credit which hydrogen producers need to prove that their electricity is "clean enough".
- RECs
  - A generating technology can choose to produce a REC or an EAC, but not both.

##### Implementation in ReEDS

- Qualifying clean technologies produce Energy Attribute Credits (EACs, similar to the REC system) which are tracked by region (h2ptcreg), vintage (commercial online year), and hour in which they are produced.
  - Qualifying clean technologies include: wind, solar PV, nuclear, gas with CCS, geothermal, hydropower
  - These are defined by the set i_h2_ptc_gen(i) and carried through the model as valcap_h2ptc and valgen_h2ptc
- Electrolyzers must purchase and retire EACs for all MWh used in order to receive the 45V credit
  - This is accomplished via the new variable CREDIT_H2PTC(i,v,r,allh,t)
- Pre-2030 those EACs can be generated at any time within the year the H2 is generated; 2030 and later the EACs must be matched hourly
- Simplifying assumption used for vintage: generators must have a commercial online date in 2024 or later in order to qualify as an EAC producer
  - Applied by restricting valcap_h2ptc to have firstyear_v(i,v)>=h2_ptc_firstyear


#### Assumptions

- We only represent technologies which qualify for the less than 0.45 kg CO2e/kg H2 lifecycle emissions category.
There may be relatively clean generators that qualify for lower $ amounts of the PTC.
However, since the $3/kg is so lucrative, it is assumed that all H2 producers will comply with the mechanisms required to prove the cleanliness of their electricity.
- This PR consists of only grid-connected electrolyzers.
We did not include off grid systems due to insufficient evidence of their BOS costs, logistical tractability and more.
However, there may be off-grid systems which are cost competitive with grid connected systems.
- SMR with CCS could technically receive the H2 PTC.
However, our back of the envelope calculations show that SMR w/ CCS plants are more likely to take 45Q so that is why ReEDS currently assumes that only electrolyzers take the H2 PTC.
- We force all electrolyzers to take 45V, and therefore we force there to be 45V-credited generation if there is electrolyzer load.
Our logic was that for an electrolyzer to be cost competitive with SMR or SMR-CCS, it would need and want to take the $3/kg 45V.
This assumption is enforced by the constraints `eq_h2_ptc_region_balance` and `eq_h2_ptc_region_hour_balance`.

#### Recommended switches to incorporate the hydrogen production tax credit into a run

| Switch | Value | Recommend or Required for running with the H2 PTC enabled | Function |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| GSw_H2_PTC | 1 | Required | Turns on and off hydrogen production tax credit  |
| GSw_H2 | 2 | Recommended | Representation of hydrogen supply/demand balance. Sw_H2=1 will not cause the model to fail but it is not recommended for the most accurate representation of the H2 PTC.  |
| GSw_H2_Demand_Case | Anything except 'none' | Recommended |  Annual H2 demand profile  |
| GSw_H2_IntraReg_Transport | 0.32 | Recommended | Flat cost for intra-ReEDS BA hydrogen transport and storage in $2004 / kg H2 produced. Note: This is now included as the default representation even if the H2 PTC is not enabled. This is assuming transport via pipelines. Transport costs could be more expensive if you assume other methods of H2 transport (ex. trucking).  |
| GSw_RetailAdder  | $0/MWh | Recommended | 2004$/MWh adder to the cost of energy consumed by hydrogen producing facilities and direct air CO2 capture facilities. Included to represent the non-bulk-power-system costs of increasing electrical loads that are not captured within ReEDS. The default value of 0 indicates an assumption that these facilities are large enough to participate directly in wholesale markets.  |

#### Other Notes

- The final version of the regulation will not be published until later in FY24, at which point this documentation will be updated to reflect the final regulations.
- Fun fact: There is an Investment Tax Credit (ITC) component to 45V.
However, all analyses (both ours and from other research groups) indicate that hydrogen producing facilties will choose to take the H2 PTC so in ReEDS we exclusively model the PTC.




## Supply curves

### Supply curve switches

Supply curve "access" scenarios: these switches are used to toggle across the different supply curve scenarios from reV.  

- `GSw_SitingGeo`
- `GSw_SitingUPV`
- `GSw_SitingWindOfs`
- `GSw_SitingWindOns`

For geothermal there are additional switches for toggling between using reV and ATB based supply curves:

- `geohydrosupplycurve`
- `egssupplycurve`
- `egsnearfieldsupplycurve`

Pumped storage supply curves can also be specified using `pshsupplycurve`.

The number of cost bins used to represent the reV-based supply curve technologies can be set dynamically by the `numbins` switches:

- `numbins_windons`
- `numbins_windofs`
- `numbins_upv`
- `numbins_csp`
- `numbins_geohydro_allkm`
- `numbins_egs_allkm`

In addition, the `GSw_ReducedResource` switch allows for a uniform reduction of supply curve capacity based on the value of `reduced_resource_frac` set in `inputs/scalars`


### Other notes

- Supply curve files can be found in `inputs/supply_curve`, with the corresponding hourly profiles for wind and solar in `inputs/variability/multi_year`
- The `rev_paths.csv` in `inputs/supply_curve`provides details on the available access case for each technology and the corresponding supply curve vintage.
- Supply curves for wind, solar, and geothermal are generated by hourlize; for more details see [Using Hourlize](hourlize.md).

### Relevant switches

1. `GSw_HierarchyFile`: Indicate the suffix of the inputs/hierarchy.csv file you wish to use.
    1. By default the transreg boundaries are used for operating reserve sharing, capacity credit calculations, and the boundaries for limited-transmission cases.
1. `GSw_TransInvMaxLongTerm`: Limit on annual transmission deployment nationwide **IN/AFTER** `firstyear_trans_longterm`, measured in TW-miles
1. `GSw_TransInvMaxNearTerm`: Limit on annual transmission deployment nationwide **BEFORE** `firstyear_trans_longterm`, measured in TW-miles
1. `GSw_TransInvPRMderate`: By default, adding 1 MW of transmission capacity between two zones increases the energy transfer capability by 1 MW but the PRM trading capability by only 0.85 MW; here you can adjust that derate
1. `GSw_TransCostMult`: Applies to interzonal transmission capacity (including AC/DC converters) but not FOM costs
1. `GSw_TransSquiggliness`: Somewhat similar to `GSw_TransCostMult`, but scales the distance for each inter-zone interface. So turning it up to 1.3 will increase costs and losses by 1.3, and for the same amount of GW it will increase TWmiles by 1.3.
1. `GSw_TransHurdle`: Intra-US hurdle rate for interzonal flows, measured in $2004/MWh
1. `GSw_TransHurdleLevel`: Indicate the level of hierarchy.csv between which to apply the hurdle rate specified by `GSw_TransHurdle`. i.e. if set to ‘st’, intra-state flows will have no hurdle rates but inter-state flows will have hurdle rates specified by `GSw_TransHurdle`.
1. `GSw_TransRestrict`: Indicate the level of hierarchy.csv within which to allow transmission expansion. i.e. if set to ‘st’, no inter-state expansion is allowed.
1. `GSw_TransScen`: Indicate the inputs/transmission/transmission_capacity_future_{`GSw_TransScen`}.csv file to use, which includes the list of interfaces that can be expanded. Note that the full list of expandable interfaces is indicated by this file plus transmission_capacity_future_default.csv (currently planned additions) plus transmission_capacity_init_AC_NARIS2024.csv (existing AC interfaces, which can be expanded by default) plus transmission_capacity_init_nonAC.csv (existing DC connections, which can be expanded by default). Applies to AC, LCC, and VSC.
1. `GSw_PRM_hierarchy_level`: Level of hierarchy.csv within which to calculate net load, used for capacity credit. Larger levels indicate more planning coordination between regions.
1. `GSw_PRMTRADE_level`: Level of hierarchy.csv within which to allow PRM trading. By default it’s set to ‘country’, indicating no limits. If set to ‘r’, no PRM trading is allowed.





## ReEDS2PRAS and PRAS

Some of the behavior of ReEDS2PRAS and PRAS (used for the stress periods resource adequacy method) can be controlled via the following switches:

- PRAS sampling
  - `pras_samples` (default 100): How many Monte Carlo samples to use in PRAS
  - `pras_seed` (default 1): Random number generator seed to use for PRAS samples; can be any positive integer.
  If 0 the seed is set randomly.
- ReEDS2PRAS unit disaggregation
  - `pras_agg_ogs_lfillgas` (default 0): If set to 1, aggregate existing o-g-s and landfill gas units to the capacity assumed for new units (from `inputs/plant_characteristics/unitsize_{pras_unitsize_source}.csv`).
  This switch is provided because these two technologies have low total capacity nationwide but many small-capacity (~1 MW) units;
  aggregating these small individual units can reduce the PRAS problem size without significantly affecting the results.
  - `pras_existing_unit_size` (default 1): If set to 1, use the average size of existing units by tech/region when disaggregating new capacity.
  Otherwise, if set to 0, use characteristic capacities from `inputs/plant_characteristics/unitsize_{pras_unitsize_source}.csv` for all new units.
  - `pras_max_unitsize_prm` (default 1): If set to 1, cap the upper bound of disaggregated unit size by zone at the zonal PRM in MW
  - `pras_unitsize_source` (default `atb`; choices are `r2x` or `atb`): Data source for characteristic unit sizes in ReESD2PRAS
  - `pras_vre_combine` (default 0): If set to 1, combine VRE into a single VRE tech in ReEDS2PRAS
- ReEDS2PRAS technology representation
  - `pras_hydro_energylim` (default 1): Model hydro as energy-limited in PRAS (1) or like a thermal generator (0)
  - `pras_include_h2dac` (default 0): If set to 1, include demand associated with H2 production & DAC in PRAS
  - `pras_trans_contingency` (default 0): Use n-0 (0) or n-1 (1) transmission capacities in PRAS

If a ReEDS case raises an out-of-memory error in ReEDS2PRAS/PRAS, the memory use can be reduced using some or all of the following settings:

- Set `pras_agg_ogs_lfillgas` to 1
- Set `pras_vre_combine` to 1
- Setting `pras_existing_unit_size` to 0 results in fewer, larger units; the reduction in the number of units reduces the memory use.
However, for zones with relatively low load and low interzonal transmission capacity,
using larger unit sizes (particularly unit sizes greater than the reserve margin) can increase the level of unserved energy;
if a single unit is larger than the planning reserve margin, unserved energy is likely whenever that unit experiences on outage.
This approach should therefore be used with caution.


## Monte Carlo Sampling (MCS)

This guide explains how to enable, configure, and run Monte Carlo simulations so you can propagate input uncertainty through ReEDS runs.

### Quick start

1. In `cases.csv`, set `MCS_runs` to the number of samples you want. Zero disables MCS.

2. Set `MCS_dist` to the suffix name of a YAML file that contains the input distribution definitions. 
For example, `default` will use `inputs/userinput/mcs_distributions_default.yaml`.

3. Set `MCS_dist_groups` to one or more YAML group names. Separate multiple groups with a dot.
   For example `tech.load_st.ng_fuel_price`.

4. Run ReEDS as usual. Each Monte Carlo draw will create its own run using the sampled inputs.

These three switches (`MCS_runs`,`MCS_dist`, and  `MCS_dist_groups`) are the only required controls.
All other settings live in the YAML file (`inputs/userinput/mcs_distributions_{MCS_dist}.yaml`).

### YAML distribution file format
Distribution groups live in `inputs/userinput/mcs_distributions_{MCS_dist}.yaml`.
Each group samples one or more switches together.

**Group field summary:**

| Field              | Type            | Values                                                                   | Purpose                              |
|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `name`             | string          | any unique id                                                            | Group id used by `MCS_dist_groups`.  |
| `assignments_list` | list of dicts   | `{switch: [values...]}`                                                  | Map each switch to candidate values. |
| `dist`             | string          | `dirichlet`, `discrete`, `triangular_multiplier`, `uniform_multiplier`   | Pick the sampling distribution.      |
| `dist_params`      | list of numbers | depends on `dist`                                                        | Parameters for the distribution.     |
| `weight_r`         | string          | spatial hierarchy level (typically `country`, `transgrp`, `st`, or `ba`) | Spatial resolution for draws.        |


**name**

- Unique id of the group.
- The id must appear in `MCS_dist_groups` to activate this group.
- Switches listed in the same group receive the same random draw, which creates perfect correlation inside the group.
To force independence, place switches in different groups.

**assignments\_list**

- A list where each item is a one key dictionary.
- Key gives the switch name. Value lists the candidate options for that switch,
referencing the underlying files or literal values that the sampler can draw from.
- Example idea: `[{switch1: [v1, v2]}, {switch2: [v1, v2]}]`.

**dist**

- `dirichlet` uses a weighted average across options.
- `discrete` selects a single option using the given weights.
- `triangular_multiplier` draws a multiplier from a triangular distribution and applies it to all files in the `assignments_list` group.
- `uniform_multiplier` draws a uniform multiplier and applies it likewise.

**dist\_params**

- `dirichlet`: `[alpha1, alpha2, ...]` concentration values. Length must match the number of options for the switches in the group.
- `discrete`: `[w1, w2, ...]` probability weights, normalized internally. Length must match the number of options.
- `triangular_multiplier`: `[low, center, high]`.
- `uniform_multiplier`: `[low, high]`.

**weight\_r**

- For some files (those with regional data) we support the possibility of applying different weights to different ReEDS hierarchies.
This field specifies the hierarchy considered.
- Common values are `country`, `transgrp`, `st`, or `ba`. 
- Support depends on the switch. ATB `plantchar_*` switches currently support only `country`.

---

**Example 1. Correlated technology sampling**

```yaml
- name: tech
  assignments_list:
    - plantchar_battery: [battery_ATB_2024_conservative, battery_ATB_2024_moderate, battery_ATB_2024_advanced]
    - plantchar_upv: [upv_ATB_2024_conservative, upv_ATB_2024_moderate, upv_ATB_2024_advanced]
    - plantchar_ofswind: [ofs-wind_ATB_2024_conservative, ofs-wind_ATB_2024_moderate, ofs-wind_ATB_2024_advanced]
  dist: dirichlet
  dist_params: [1, 1, 1]
  weight_r: country
```

`Sample_battery = W1*(conservative) + W2*(moderate) + W3*(advanced)`\
`Sample_upv = W1*(conservative) + W2*(moderate) + W3*(advanced)`\
with the same `W1, W2, W3` and `W1 + W2 + W3 = 1`.

In this configuration all three technologies share the same Dirichlet draw
(so a sample with low-cost PV also has low-cost batteries and offshore wind).

**Example 2. Sampling load forecast scenarios per state**

```yaml
- name: load_st
  assignments_list:
    - GSw_EFS1_AllYearLoad: [EER_100by2050, EER_IRAlow]
  dist: dirichlet
  dist_params: [1, 1]
  weight_r: st
```

Each state receives its own weighted combination of the two load scenarios.\
`Sample_load = W1*(EER_100by2050) +  W2*(EER_IRAlow)` with `W1 + W2 = 1`.

**Example 3. Discrete siting uncertainty for wind and solar**

```yaml
- name: wind_solar_siting_st
  assignments_list:
    - GSw_SitingUPV: [limited, reference]
    - GSw_SitingWindOfs: [limited, reference]
    - GSw_SitingWindOns: [limited, reference]
  dist: discrete
  dist_params: [1, 1]
  weight_r: st
```

This enables state level uncertainty in siting supply curves for wind and solar technologies through a random draw between `limited` and `reference` conditions.

### Tips

- Use multiple distribution groups to sample switches independently.
For example `tech.load_st` defines two groups that are sampled independently.
- Sampling of float values (e.g., transmission multipliers) is supported using `*_multiplier` distribution types.
- The **Dirichlet** distribution defines weights applied to each scenario. 
When all concentration parameters are set to one (e.g., `[1, 1, 1]`), the distribution is considered uninformed;
it assigns equal expected weight to all options, though individual samples will still vary. 
These parameters can be adjusted to emphasize or de-emphasize specific scenarios.
Since these weights are used as multiplicative factors on reference files,
Dirichlet sampling tends to favor combinations that lean toward central scenarios when the inputs represent "low",
"medium", and "high" pathways.

See below examples of weights for Dirichlet distributions using different concentration parameters and an arbitrary set of
Low, Mod, and High values ({numref}`figure-mcs-three-param-dirichlet` and {numref}`figure-mcs-two-param-dirichlet`).

Built-in plotting funcationality for Monte Carlo runs is described under [Uncertainty Plots](#uncertainty-plots).



## Modeling to Generate Alternatives (MGA)

The following switches control the MGA functionality:

- `GSw_MGA_CostDelta` (default `0`): Fraction by which to allow objective function to increase when using MGA.
MGA is turned off if set to 0; a reasonable choice for MGA is in the range of 0.01.
- `GSw_MGA_Direction` (default `min`): Directionality of the second optimization.
Options are `min` or `max`.
- `GSw_MGA_Objective` (default `capacity`): Objective for MGA (uses `GSw_MGA_SubObjective` to specify technology subset if set to `capacity`).
Options are `capacity`, `transmission`, `rasharing`, and `co2`.
- `GSw_MGA_SubObjective` (default `fossil`): Technology subset to minimize or maximize the capacity of (only used for `GSw_MGA_Objective = capacity`).
Options are the column names in the `inputs/tech-subset-table.csv` file.

Users familiar with GAMS can add alternative objective functions to the `c_mga.gms` file and associated options to the `GSw_MGA_Objective` switch in `cases.csv`.




## Uncertainty Plots

ReEDS includes plotting tools to help explore how uncertainty affects model results,
especially in Monte Carlo or MGA-style simulations. 
By scanning a folder of ReEDS runs, the module reads input and output data and automatically generates a PowerPoint
presentation with key trends and uncertainty ranges, along with an Excel workbook containing the raw data behind each figure.

These outputs make it easier to:
- Visualize median trends and percentile bands across runs 
- Examine distributions of variables across sampled scenarios 
- Compare differences between groups of runs

## Troubleshooting

This section provides guidance on identifying and resolving common issues encountered during model execution. By checking the locations and files listed below, users can better pinpoint errors.

### Key Areas for Error Checking

- GAMS Log File
  - Path: `/runs/{batch_prefix}_{case}/gamslog.txt`
  - Purpose: contains the log outputs for all execution statements from the case batch file
  - What to look for:
    - 'ERROR': will provide more information into the specific file or line in the source code that failed or has an error
    - 'LP status' and 'Status': can provide more insight into the model run
    - 'Cur_year': can help you determine which year the model run failed in

- GAMS Listing Files
  - Path: `/runs//{batch_prefix}_{case}/lstfiles/`
  - Purpose: contains the listing files for GAMS executions
  - What to look for:
    - `1_inputs.lst`: errors will be preceded by `****`
    - `{batch_prefix}_{case}_{year}i0.lst`: there should be one file for each year of the model run
    - `Augur_errors_{year}`: this file will appear in the event that there is an augur-related issue

- GAMS Workfiles
  - Path: `/runs/{batch_prefix}_{case}/g00files/`
  - Purpose: stores a snapshot of all the model information available to GAMS at that point in the case execution. More information about GAMS work files can be found here: [https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_SaveRestart.html](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_SaveRestart.html)
  - What to look for:
    - `{batch_prefix}_{case}_{last year run}i0.g00`: should exist for the last year run

- Output Directory
  - Path: `/runs/{batch_prefix}_{case}/outputs/`
  - Purpose: the outputs folder contains the generated output files from the model run
  - What to look for:
    - `*.csv` files: there should be many `.csv` files in this folder
      - these files should contain data, an error message "GDX file not found" indicates an issue with the reporting script at the end of the model
    - `reeds-report/` and `reeds-report-reduced/`: if these folders are not present, it can indicate a problem with the post-processing scripts

- Augur Data
  - Path: `/runs/{batch_prefix}_{case}/ReEDS_Augur/augur_data/`
  - What to look for:
    - `ReEDS_Augur_{year}.gdx`: there should be a file for each year of the model run =
    - `reeds_data_{year}.gdx`: there should be a file for each year of the model run

- Case Inputs
  - Path: `/runs/{batch_prefix}_{case}/inputs_case/`
  - What to look for:
    - `*.csv` files: there should be many `.csv` files in this folder, if there isn't, it could indicate a problem with the pre-processing scripts
    - `inputs.gdx`: if this doesn't exist, it could indicate a problem with the pre-processing scripts

### Re-running a Failed ReEDS Case

To re-run a failed case from the year it failed:

1. Comment out all the execution statements that completed successfully in `/runs/{batch_prefix}_{case}/call_{batch_prefix}_{case}.bat` (or *.sh file if on Mac)
   - Shortcut for commenting multiple lines: Ctrl + `/` (Command + `/` if on Mac)

2. Re-run `/runs/{batch_prefix}_{case}/call_{batch_prefix}_{case}.bat`

Additionally, 'restart_runs.py' is a helper script that can be used to restart any failed runs. For more information on how to use this script, see the section on [Helper Scripts and Tools](postprocessing_tools.md#helper-scripts-and-tools).

### Diagnoses of ReEDS Case

The ReEDS repository includes a diagnostic tool that provides detailed model information, such as right-hand side values, the A matrix, and statistics for variables and equations.
To facilitate this, GAMS offers the CONVERT tool, which transforms a GAMS model instance into a scalar model, converting it into formats compatible with other modeling and solution systems.
For more information about CONVERT, please refer to the [GAMS documentation](https://www.gams.com/47/docs/S_CONVERT.html#:~:text=CONVERT%20is%20a%20utility%20which,other%20modeling%20and%20solution%20systems).
The diagnose_process.py script, is located in "postprocessing/diagnose", analyzes the CONVERT outputs to generate model characteristics in CSV files.
These characteristics include:

- The number of variables, equations, and non-zero values.
- Reporting variables (if any), along with their names.
- Dense columns and their counts.
- Matrix statistics:
  - Minimum, maximum, absolute minimum, absolute maximum.
  - Ratio of max(abs) to min(abs).
  - Number of reporting variables.
  - Share of reporting variables in total variables.
  - Share of reporting variables in total non-zero variables.
- Equation RHS statistics:
  - Maximum, minimum, absolute maximum, and absolute minimum values.
  - The equations with the maximum and minimum RHS values.

For more information on how to generate these report, see the [diagnose documentation](diagnose.md).
