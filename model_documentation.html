<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h2>
<p>ReEDS is a mathematical programming model of the electric power sector. Given a set of input assumptions, ReEDS models the evolution and operation of generation, storage, transmission, and production technologies. The model uses a linear program to find the cost-minimizing levels of power sector expenditures, including capital investments and operating costs, while meeting demand, reliability, resource, transmission, and policy constraints.</p>
<p>Detailed documentation of ReEDS 2.0 input files are available <a class="reference internal" href="sources.html"><span class="std std-doc">here</span></a>, and the model is available publicly at https://github.com/NREL/ReEDS-2.0.</p>

<section id="acknowledgments">
<h2>Acknowledgments<a class="headerlink" href="#acknowledgments" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h2>
<p>We gratefully acknowledge the many people whose efforts contributed to this model and its documentation. The ReEDS modeling and analysis team at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is active in developing and testing the ReEDS model version with each release. We also acknowledge the vast number of current and past NREL employees on and beyond the ReEDS team who have participated in data and model development, testing, and analysis. We are especially grateful to Walter Short who first envisioned and developed the Wind Deployment System (WinDS) and ReEDS models. Finally, we are grateful to all those who helped sponsor ReEDS model development and analysis, particularly supporters from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) but also others who have funded our work over the years.</p>

<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h2>
<p>This document describes the structure and key data elements of the Regional Energy Deployment System model, which is maintained and operated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref1" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> In this introduction, we provide a high-level overview of ReEDS objectives, capabilities, and applications.

<h3>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>ReEDS is a mathematical programming model of the electric power sector. Given a set of input assumptions, ReEDS models the evolution and operation of generation, storage, transmission, and production<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref2" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> technologies. The results can be used to explore the impacts of a variety of future technological and policy scenarios on, for example, economic and environmental outcomes for the entire power sector or for specific stakeholders.</p>
<p>The electricity system is represented in the model by separating the system into model regions, each of which has sources of supply and demand. Regions are connected by a representation of the transmission network, which includes existing transmission capacity and endogenous new capacity. The model represents all existing generating units, planned future builds, and endogenous new capacity within each region. The model is intended to solve on the decadal scale, though the time horizon for a particular model run (and the intervening model solve years) can be selected by the user. Within each year, selected representative periods are used to characterize seasonal and diurnal patterns in supply and demand (with the option to run with all hours if computational bandwidth allows). In addition, grid reliability is represented through the use of stress periods and linkages to the Probabilistic Resource Adequacy Suite model <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2030" title="Gord Stephen.

<h3>ReEDS History<a class="headerlink" href="#reeds-history" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>The ReEDS model heritage traces back to National Renewable Energy Laboratoryâs (NRELâs) seminal electric sector capacity expansion model, called the Wind Deployment System (WinDS) model. The WinDS model was developed beginning in 2001 to examine long-term market potential of wind in the electric power sector <span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1969" title="Walter Short, Nate Blair, Donna Heimiller, and Vikram Singh.

From 2003 to 2008, WinDS was used in a variety of wind-related analyses, including the production of hydrogen from wind power, the impacts of state-level policies on wind deployment, the role of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in wind markets, the impacts of high wind penetration on U.S wind manufacturing, the potential forÂ offshore wind, the benefits of storage to wind power, and the feasibility of producing 20% ofÂ U.S. electricity from wind power by 2030 <span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id729" title="DOE. 20% Wind Energy by 2030: Increasing Wind Energy's Contribution to U.S. Electricity Supply.

In 2006, a variation of WinDS was developed to analyze concentrating solar power (CSP) potential and its response to state and federal incentives.

<h3>Summary of Caveats<a class="headerlink" href="#summary-of-caveats" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>Though ReEDS represents many aspects of the U.S. electricity system, it necessitates simplifications, as all models do. We offer a list of some important limitations and caveats that result from these simplifications.</p>
<p><strong>System-wide optimization:</strong> ReEDS takes a system-wide, least-cost perspective that does not necessarily reflect the perspectives of individual decision makers, including specific investors, regional market participants, or corporate or individual consumers; nor does it model contractual obligations or noneconomic decisions. In addition, like other optimization models, ReEDS finds the absolute (deterministic) least-cost solution that does not fully reflect real distributions or uncertainties in the parameters; however, the heterogeneity resulting from the high spatial resolution of ReEDS mitigates this effect toÂ some degree.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Resolution:</strong> Though ReEDS has high spatial, temporal, and process resolution for models of its class and scope, it cannot generally represent individual units and transmission lines, and it does not have the temporal resolution to characterize detailed operating behaviors, such as ramp rates and minimum plant runtime. It also generally only samples representative time periods within a year rather than modeling all hours in a year due to computational challenges. The linkage with PRAS, which includes chronological hourly modeling for multiple years, helps to ensure the ReEDS portfolios meet specified resource adequacy levels.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Foresight and behavior:</strong> ReEDS has an option for intertemporal optimization of all solve years, but in most cases solve years are evaluated sequentially and myopically. The model has limited foresight and its decision-making does not account for anticipated changes to markets and policies. ForÂ example, ReEDS typically does not endogenously model banking and borrowing of credits for carbon, renewable, or clean energy policy between solve years. In addition, ReEDSâ dispatch modeling does not explicitly consider forecast errors, although operating reserves can be modeled.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Project pipeline:</strong> The model incorporates data of planned or under-construction projects, but these data do not include <em>all</em> projects in progress.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Manufacturing, supply chain, and siting:</strong> The model does not explicitly simulate manufacturing, supply chain, or siting and permitting processes. Potential bottlenecks or delays in project development stages for new generation or transmission are not fully reflected in the results. All technologies are assumed to be available at their defined capital cost in any quantity up to their technical resource potential. Penalties for rapid growth can be applied in ReEDS; however, these do not fully consider all potential manufacturing or deployment limits. Dates associated with cost inputs in the model reflect project costs for the commercial operation date but not necessarily when equipment is ordered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Financing:</strong> Though the model can use annually varying financing parameters to capture near-term market conditions and technology-specific financing to account for differences in typical investment strategies across technologies, ReEDS cannot fully represent differences in project financing terms across markets or ownership types and thus does not allow multiple financing options for a given technology or between regions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology learning:</strong> Future technology improvements are considered exogenously and thus are not a function of deployment in each scenario.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Power sector:</strong> ReEDS models only the power sector within its defined regional scope (contiguous United States), and it does not represent the broader U.S. or global energy economy. For example, competing uses of resources (e.g., natural gas) across sectors are not dynamically represented in ReEDS, and end-use electricity demand or non-power H2 demand are exogenously inputs to ReEDS.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Notwithstanding these limitationsâmany of which exist in other similar toolsâthe modeling approach considers complex interactions among numerous policies and technologies while ensuring electric system reliability requirements are maintained within the resolution and scope of the model. In doing so, ReEDS can comprehensively estimate the system cost and value of aÂ wide range of technology options given a set of assumptions, and we can use the model to generate self-consistent future deployment portfolios.</p>
<p>A comparison against historical data using ReEDS was completed by Cole and Vincent <span id="id24"><a class="reference internal" href="#id604" title="Wesley J. Cole and Nina M.

<h2>Modeling Framework<a class="headerlink" href="#modeling-framework" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h2>
<p>In this section, we describe the modeling framework underlying ReEDS, including the modular structure of the model (and how outputs are passed between modules and convergence is achieved), spatial resolution, temporal resolution, technology represented, and the model formulations.</p>
<section id="model-structure">
<h3>Model Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#model-structure" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>ReEDS is typically run sequentially, where the optimal system design is identified for each solve year at a time starting in the initial year and through a final year (e.g., 2050). The increments between solve years are user-defined but most studies use 2-year, 3-year, or 5-year increments. Increments can also vary between different solve years, e.g., annual increments can be used in the near term followed by multi-year increments in the latter years. <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-reeds-structure"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 16</span></a> illustrates the modelâs sequential structure. For a given solve year <em>t</em>, ReEDS iterates with the PRAS model to dynamically update stress periods and check for reliability (see more in <a class="reference internal" href="#resource-adequacy"><span class="xref myst">Resource Adequacy</span></a>). Once the system design is found to be resource adequate, ReEDS advances to the next model solve year (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t + \Delta t\)</span>).<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref5" id="id25" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>4<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

<section id="model-formulation">
<h3>Model Formulation<a class="headerlink" href="#model-formulation" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>ReEDS uses a linear program that governs the evolution and operation of the generation and transmission system. It seeks to minimize power sector costs as it makes various operational and investment decisions, subject to a set of constraints on those decisions.</p>
<p>The objective function is a minimization of both capital and operating costs for the U.S. electric sector, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The present value of the cost of adding or upgrading new generation, storage, demand response, and transmissionÂ capacity (including project financing)</p></li>
<li><p>The present value of operating expenses over the evaluation period<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref6" id="id26" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>5<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> (e.g., expenditures for fuel and operation and maintenance [O&amp;M]) for all installed capacity</p></li>
<li><p>The cost of several categories of ancillary services and storage</p></li>
<li><p>The cost of production technologies (e.g., hydrogen), direct air capture, and CO<sub>2</sub> pipelines and storage</p></li>
<li><p>The cost of water access (if water resource constraints are active)</p></li>
<li><p>The cost or incentive applied by any policies that directly charge or credit generation orÂ capacity</p></li>
<li><p>Penalties for rapid capacity growth as a proxy for manufacturing, supply chain, and siting/permitting limitations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By minimizing these costs and meeting the system constraints (discussed below), the linear program determines the types of new capacity to construct (and existing capacity to retire) in each region during each model year to minimize system-wide cost. Simultaneously, the linear program determines how generation and storage capacity should be dispatched to provide the necessary grid services for all periods. The capacity factor for each technology, therefore, is an output of the model and not an input assumption.</p>
<p>The constraints that govern how ReEDS builds and operates capacity fall into several main categories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Load Balance Constraints</strong>: Sufficient power must be generated within or imported by the transmission system to meet the projected load in each of the 134 balancing areas (BAs) in each of timesteps during representative periods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resource Adequacy Constraints</strong>: Resource adequacy is a component of reliability that ensures sufficient available capacity to meet forecasted demand in all hours while accounting for outages and demand forecast errors. Constraints to meet resource adequacy requirements are applied during the âstress periodsâ and based on the linkage between ReEDS and PRAS as described in the <a class="reference internal" href="#resource-adequacy"><span class="xref myst">Resource Adequacy section</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operating Reserve Constraints:</strong> For shorter timescales, unexpected changes in generation and load are handled by the operating reserve requirements, which are applied for each reserve-sharing group (<a class="reference internal" href="#operational-reliability"><span class="xref myst">Operational Reliability</span></a>). ReEDS can account for the following operating reserve requirements: regulation reserves, spinning reserves, and flexibility reserves.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Generator Operating Constraints:</strong> Technology-specific constraints bound the minimum and maximum power production and capacity commitment based on physical limitations and assumed average outage rates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transmission Constraints:</strong> Power transfers among regions are constrained by the nominal carrying capacity of transmission corridors that connect the regions. Transmission constraints also apply to reserve sharing. A detailed description of the transmission constraints can be found in <a class="reference internal" href="#transmission"><span class="xref myst">Transmission</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resource Constraints:</strong> Many renewable technologies, including wind, solar, geothermal, biopower, and hydropower, are spatially heterogeneous and constrained by the quantity available at each location. Several of the technologies include cost- and resource-quality considerations in resource supply curves to account for depletion, transmission, and competition effects. The resource assessments that seed the supply curves come from various sources; these are discussed in <a class="reference internal" href="#technology-descriptions"><span class="xref myst">Technology Descriptions</span></a>, where characteristics of each technology are also provided. CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration and water resource constraints are also represented.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Emissions Constraints:</strong> ReEDS can limit or cap the emissions from fossil-fueled generators for sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e), which includes CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>0. TheÂ emission limit and the emission per megawatt-hour by fuel and plant type are inputs to the model. Negative emissions are allowed using biomass with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) or direct air capture (DAC), and the emission constraint is based on net emissions. Emissions can be capped or taxed, with flexibility for applying either. Alternatively, emissions intensities can also be limited to certain bounds in ReEDS. The emissions constraints can be applied to stack emissions, or can be based on CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emissions, with the latter including emissions from upstream methane leakage.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref8" id="id27" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>6<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> Methane leakage rates are input by the user.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Renewable Portfolio Standards or Clean Electricity Standards:</strong> ReEDS can represent renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) and clean electricity standards constraints atÂ the national and state levels. All renewable generation is considered eligible under a national RPS requirement. The renewable generation sources include hydropower, wind, CSP, geothermal, PV, and biopower (including the biomass fraction of cofiring plants). The eligibility of technologies for state RPSs depends on the stateâs specific requirements and thus varies by state. RPS targets over time are based on an externally defined profile. Penalties for noncompliance can be imposed for each megawatt-hour shortfall occurring in the country or a given state. In the same way, a clean energy standard constraint can be implemented to include non-renewable low-emissions energy resources, such as nuclear and fossil fuels with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) (<a class="reference internal" href="#clean-energy-standards"><span class="xref myst">Clean Energy Standards</span></a>).</p></li>

The model BAs are not designed to represent or align perfectly with real balancing authority areas; they are county aggregates intended to represent model nodes where electricity supply and demand is balanced. The modelâs synthetic transmission network connects the BAs and is composed of roughly 300 representative corridors across the three asynchronous interconnections: the Western Interconnection, the Eastern Interconnection, and Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). The BAs also respect state boundaries, allowing the model to represent individual state regulations and incentives. Additional geographical layers used for defining model characteristics include 3 synchronous interconnections, 18 model regional transmission operators designed after existing regional transmission operators, 19 North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) reliability subregions, 9 census divisions as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, and 48 states.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref10" id="id29" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>8<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> The spatial configuration in the model is flexible, such that the model can be run at various resolutions (e.g., aggregations of balancing areas), and data within the model are filtered to only include data for the regions being modeled in a given scenario.</p>

<h3>Temporal Resolution<a class="headerlink" href="#temporal-resolution" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>Some energy system models solve a full chronological year at hourly resolution in order to capture the time dependent variability that pervades increasingly renewable systems. However, high temporal resolution coupled with high spatial resolution can lead to intractable optimization problems. For instance, in ReEDS, solving model years in chronological 4-hour steps for a national run is only possible when the model regions are aggregated and the complexity of the scenario is reduced to eliminate some constraints. Given the computational challenges, power system planning models typically forgo full annual temporal resolution and instead select representative periods to capture variability <span id="id31">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id989" title="Christian Etienne Fleischer.

The two-step optimization first weights periods to minimize error in regional capacity factor and load data over all features (wind capacity factor, solar capacity factor, and load) and all regions as described by (1). The error is defined as the difference between the sum of the weighted regional profiles for wind, solar, and load and the actual regional profiles over all periods and all regions as described in (2). The result of this minimization is a selection of representative days weighted by number of total days in the year.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\min \sum_{f,r}^{F,R} E_{1+}(f,r) + E_{1-}(f,r)\]</div>

<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[E_{1+}(f,r) + E_{1-}(f,r) = \sum_{p}^{P} W(p)x(p,f,r) - \sum_{p}^{P} x(p,f,r) \quad \forall \ f,r\]</div>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>In the second step of the optimization, actual periods are mapped to the most similar representative period by again minimizing the sum of absolute error over all periods, features, and regions. The error in this minimization problem is defined as the difference between the actual profile for a given actual period and the representative profile for the period that actual period is mapped to. Since each actual period can only be mapped to a single representative day, the problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program as described in (3) and (4).</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\min [ \sum_{p_a,f,r}^{P,F,R} x(p_a,f,r) - \sum_{p_r}^{P_r} M(p_a,p_r) x(p_r,f,r)]\]</div>

<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\sum_{p_r}^{P_r} M(p_a, p_r) = 1 \quad \forall \ p_a\]</div>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>In conjunction, the results of both optimizations lead to a set of representative periods where the weighting determined in step one indicates the number of times a representative period will be used over the course of the year. For example, a representative day weighted by 36 will be used to replace the 36 actual days of the year which are most similar. Ultimately this optimization-based approach to identify representative periods helps to reduce the required number of periods while also capturing regional trends.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Period resolution: days, 5-day âweeksâ, or chronological year</p></li>
<li><p>Timeslice chunks: 4-hour default but can use 1-, 2-, or 3-hour chunks for smaller system</p></li>

</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Inter-day linkage needs to be established for long-duration energy storage (LDES). Simulating LDES requires inter-period linkage to reflect seasonal state-of-charge (SOC) changes. This can be achieved by using a fully chronological year at hourly resolution with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_HourlyType</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">'year'</span></code>, but this approach is computationally intensive. Alternatively, ReEDS offers an inter-day linkage option that enables SOC linkage across representative days while maintaining high computational efficiency. This inter-day linkage can be activated using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_InterDayLinkage</span></code>, which is designed to work with the representative day and week method (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_HourlyType</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">'day'</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">'wek'</span></code>). Currently, inter-day linkage is supported for batteries with durations of 12, 24, 48, 72, and 100 hours. Without the inter-day linkage, SOC is typically limited to intra-day changes and resets at the end of each representative period, preventing inter-period variations. However, with inter-day linkage enabled, SOC can evolve across multiple periods, with fidelity improving as the number of representative periods increases, as demonstrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-sparse-chronology"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 18</span></a>. The inter-day linkage is built using a sparse chronology strategy, a recently developed method that is computationally efficient and accurate, as referenced in <span id="id34">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id543">Chen <em>et al.</em>, n.d.</a>]</span>.</p>

<section id="offshore-wind">
<h4>Offshore Wind<a class="headerlink" href="#offshore-wind" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>ReEDS represents two distinct offshore wind technologies: Fixed and floating. Base cost and performance assumptions in ReEDS for the two technologies are based on one reference fixed offshore site in New York Bight and one reference floating offshore site in Humboldt county, California, including capital costs, fixed O&amp;M costs, and average capacity factor improvements over time.</p>
<p>There is substantial diversity in offshore wind generators, in distance from shore, water depth, and resource quality. ReEDS subdivides offshore wind potential into ten resource classes: five each for fixed-bottom and floating turbine designs. Fixed bottom offshore wind development is limited to resources &lt; 60 meters [m] in depth using either current-technology monopile foundations (0â30 m); or jacket (truss-style) foundations (30â60 m). Offshore wind using a floating anchorage could be developed for greater depths and are assumed the only feasible technology for development for resource deeper than 60 m. Within each category, the classes are distinguished by resource quality, and then supply curves differentiate resource by cost of accessing transmission in a similar fashion as land-based wind but using 5 cost bins per region and class.</p>
<p>Eligible offshore area for wind development includes open water within the U.S.-exclusive economic zone having a water depth less than 1,000 m, including the Great Lakes. As with land-based resource, offshore zones are filtered to remove areas considered unsuitable for development, including national marine sanctuaries, marine protected areas, wildlife refuges, shipping and towing lanes, offshore platforms, and ocean pipelines. The offshore technology selection is made using the Offshore Wind Cost Model, which selects the most economically feasible technology for developing a wind resource <span id="id45">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id362" title="Philipp Beiter and Tyler Stehly.

<p>Each wind site in a supply curve is characterized in ReEDS by a supply curve cost, which comprises of capital adder and transmission adder costs. The capital adder incorporates the site-specific technology, regional differences, and economies of scale. Refer to <span id="id48">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1966" title="Matt Shields, Philipp Beiter, Jake Nunemaker, Aubryn Cooperman, and Patrick Duffy. Impacts of turbine and plant upsizing on the levelized cost of energy for offshore wind.

The transmission cost adder includes the array, export (âwetâ) costs, and poi/substation, spurline, and reinforcement (âdryâ) costs. The site capital cost adder is aggregated into region-bin-class to sync with the reference site âbaseâ overnight capital cost from the ATB.</p>
<p>At the end of 2023, the IRS defines energy property and rules applicable to energy credit, effectively defines the cost items that an offshore wind project is eligible for the ITC. Refer to <span id="id49">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1281" title="IRS.

In ReEDS, this translates into array, export cable and substation/POI costs. However, for consistency in implementation with other technologies, since the components that are not eligible for the ITC (spur-line and reinforcement) take up of only 22% of transmission costs, while transmission costs take up of only 30% of total cost, we decided to apply the ITC to all transmission cost components to make OSW format consistent with LBW (the extra error in applying the ITC to all transmission cost components versus to just the ITC eligible components is just about 2%).</p>

<p>UPV in ReEDS represents utility-scale, single-axis-tracking PV systems with a representative size of 1 megawatt (MW) and an array density of 43 MW per square kilometer (km<sup>2</sup>). The model assumes an inverter loading ratio of 1.34 (represented in ReEDS by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ilr_utility</span></code> scalar). Resource potential is assumed to be located on large parcels outside urban boundaries, excluding federally protected lands, inventoried âroadlessâ areas, U.S. Bureau of Land Management areas of critical environmental concern, and areas of excessive slope, and other exclusions. ReEDS provides supply curves and profiles representing three siting exclusion scenarios: reference, limited, and open access. These scenarios are controlled by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_SitingUPV</span></code> switch.</p>
<p>Each eligible UPV site is characterized by an hourly irradiance profile that is representative of the solar resource within a 10 km<sup>2</sup> contiguous area, using irradiance data from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) <span id="id52">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1945" title="Manajit Sengupta, Yu Xie, Anthony Lopez, Aron Habte, Galen Maclaurin, and James Shelby.

<h5><em>PVB</em><a class="headerlink" href="#pvb" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h5>
<p>For hybrid systems, the default technology represents a loosely DC-coupled system in which the PV and battery technologies share a bi-directional inverter and point of interconnection, and the battery can charge from either the coupled PV or the grid. The PVB design characteristics can be user defined for up to three different configurations, but the default configuration involves an inverter loading ratio of 2.2 (slightly higher than standalone PV), and a coupled battery with 4hr duration, whose power-rated capacity is 50% of the inverter capacity.</p>
<p>The PVB investment option leverages the existing representations of the independent component technologies, but the cost and performance characteristics differ from the simple sum of the separate (PV and battery) parts. For example, the capital costs associated with the fully integrated PVB hybrid system are reduced based on the cost of a shared inverter and other balance-of-system components; as a result, the percentage savings varies by PVB configuration. Improved performance characteristics are captured through slightly enhanced battery round trip efficiencies and explicit time series generation profiles; the latter enables a representation of the PVB systemâs ability to divert otherwise-clipped energy to the coupled battery (during periods where solar output exceeds the inverter capacity) and avoid curtailment.</p>

<p>Rooftop PV includes commercial, industrial, and residential systems. These systems are assumed to have an inverter loading ratio of 1.1 (represented in ReEDS by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ilr_dist</span></code> scalar). Existing rooftop PV capacities are obtained from EIA-861 data spanning 2010 to 2022 <span id="id56">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id807" title="EIA.

The default dGen trajectories used in this version of ReEDS are based on the residential and commercial PV cost projections as described in the 2023 <span id="id58">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1726" title="NREL. 2023 Annual Technology Baseline.

ReEDS makes available several different potential trajectories for distPV adoption, governed by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">distpvscen</span></code> switch. These trajectories were created by running a ReEDS scenario and feeding the electricity price outputs from ReEDS back into dGen. The trajectories incorporate existing net metering policy as of spring 2023, and they include the investment tax credit (ITC) as discussed in <a class="reference internal" href="#federal-and-state-tax-incentives"><span class="xref myst">Federal and State Tax Incentives</span></a>. To mitigate excessive wheeling of distributed PV generation, ReEDS assumes all power generated by rooftop PV systems is permitted to be exported to neighboring BAs only when total generation in the source region exceeds the load for a given time-slice. UPV-generated electricity, in contrast, can be exported in all time-slices and regions.</p>
<p>Assumptions for each dGen scenario are made consistent with the ReEDS scenario assumptions as much as is possible. For example, the Tax Credit Extension (ITC) scenario also includes an extension of the ITC in dGen, and the Low PV Cost scenario uses the low cost trajectory from ATB for commercial and rooftop PV costs.</p>
<p>reV produces hourly generation profiles for 2007-2023 weather years using the NSRDB point closest to the centroid of each county in the contiguous United States. The profiles represent residential and commercial systems with a 16 degree tilt and 180 degree azimuth. The residential profiles assume an inverter efficiency of 96%, and the commerical profiles assume an inverter efficiency of 98%. To create a single profile for each region, we determine the NSRDB point(s) existing in or, if none exist, closest to the region and take the average of the corresponding profiles.</p>
<p>ReEDS assumes that distributed PV generation is not allowed to be curtailed.</p>

<p>The three default CSP resource classes are defined by power density of DNI, developable land area having been filtered based on land cover type, slope, and protected status. CSP resource in each region is represented by the same supply curve as UPV in (<a class="reference internal" href="#solar-photovoltaics"><span class="xref myst">Solar Photovoltaics</span></a>).

CSP capacity credit calculations are based on hourly profiles from 2007-2013. Resources are then scaled in ReEDS by the ratio of the solar multiple of the CSP plant.</p>
<p>The representative CSP system without storage used to define system performance in ReEDS is a 100-MW trough system with a SM of 1.4. As CSP systems without storage are non-dispatchable, output capacity factors are defined directly from SAM results. The average annual capacity factors for the solar fields of these systems range from 20% (Class 1 resource) to 29% (Class 12 resource).</p>

<section id="geothermal">
<h4>Geothermal<a class="headerlink" href="#geothermal" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>The geothermal resource has two distinct subcategories in ReEDS:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The hydrothermal resource represents potential sites with appropriate geological characteristics for the extraction of heat energy. The hydrothermal potential included in the base supply curve consists of only identified sites, with aÂ separate supply curve representing the undiscovered hydrothermal resource.</p></li>
<li><p>EGS sites are geothermal resources that have sufficient temperature but lack the natural permeability, in-situ fluids, or both, to be hydrothermal systems. Developing these sites with water injection wells could create engineered geothermal reservoirs appropriate for harvesting heat.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>EGS is further separated into near-field EGS and deep EGS based upon proximity to known hydrothermal features. Near-field EGS represents additional geothermal resource available near hydrothermal fields which have been identified. Deep EGS represents available geothermal resource not tied to existing hydrothermal sites and at depths below 3.5 km.</p>
<p>Geothermal in ReEDS represents a geothermal power production with representative size up to 100 megawatts electric (MW<sub>e</sub>). Geothermal resource classes are defined by reservoir temperature ranges which are closely linked to the cost of a plant normalized by generation capacity. Energy conversion processes, binary and flash cycles, are linked to reservoir temperature and are specified by resource class. Plants with reservoir temperatures &lt; 200 Â°C (Class 7-10) use a binary cycle, which uses a heat exchanger and secondary working fluid with a lower boiling point to drive a turbine. All other reservoir temperatures assume that a turbine is driven directly by working fluid from the geothermal wells. These assumptions are aligned with those in ATB 2023.</p>

Upgrade availability at federal facilities not included in the HMI is assumed to be the HMI average of 8% of the rated capacity, and upgrade availability at non-federal facilities is assumed to be the NHAAP average of 10% of the rated capacity. Rather than making all upgrade potential available immediately, upgrade potential is made available over time at the earlier of either (1) the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) license expiration (if applicable) or (2) the turbine age reaching 50 years. This feature better reflects institutional barriers and industry practices surrounding hydropower facility upgrades. The total upgrade potential from this methodology is 6.9 GW (27 TWh/yr).</p>

<p>The hydropower operating parameters and constraints included in ReEDS do not fully reflect the complex set of operating constraints on hydropower in the real world. Detailed site-specific considerations involving a full set of water management challenges are not easily represented in a model with the scale and scope of ReEDS, but several available parameters allow a stylized representation of actual hydropower operating constraints <span id="id77">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2035" title="Brady Stoll, Juan Andrade, Stuart Cohen, Greg Brinkman, and Carlo Brancucci Martinez-Anido. Hydropower Modeling Challenges. Technical Report NREL/TP-5D00-68231, National Renewable Energy Lab. (NREL), Golden, CO (United States), April 2017. doi:10.2172/1353003.">Stoll <em>et al.</em>, 2017</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Each hydropower category can be differentiated into âdispatchableâ or ânon-dispatchableâ capacity, with âdispatchableâ defined in ReEDS as the ability to provide the following services:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Diurnal load following within the capacity and average daily energy limits for eachÂ season</p></li>
<li><p>Planning (adequacy) reserves with full rated capacity</p></li>
<li><p>Operating reserves up to a specified fraction of rated capacity if the capacity is not currently being utilized for energy production.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>âNon-dispatchableâ capacity, on the other hand, provides:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Constant energy output in each season such that all available energy is utilized</p></li>
<li><p>Planning reserves equal to the output power for each season</p></li>
<li><p>No operating reserves.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Dispatchable capacity is also parameterized by a fractional minimum load, with the maximum fractional capacity available for operating reserves as one minus the fractional minimum load. The existing fleet and its corresponding upgrade potential are differentiated by dispatchability using data from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Existing Hydropower Assets Plant Database (<a class="reference external" href="https://hydrosource.ornl.gov/dataset/EHA2023">https://hydrosource.ornl.gov/dataset/EHA2023</a>), which classifies plants by operating mode. Plants with operating modes labeled as Peaking, Intermediate Peaking, Run-of-River/Upstream Peaking, and Run-of-River/Peaking are classified as dispatchable in ReEDS, and plants with other operating modes are classified as non-dispatchable. In total, 47% of existing capacity and 49% of upgrade potential is assumed non-dispatchable. ReEDS also includes the option to enable hydropower upgrade pathways where existing non-dispatchable hydropower can be upgraded to be dispatchable hydropower, or existing dispatchable hydropower can be upgraded to add pumping and become a pump-back hydropower facility. A pump-back facility is constrained similarly to a PSH facility except that input energy can come from natural water inflows in addition to the grid. These upgrade options can be made available at a user-specified capital cost. Hydropower upgrades are unavailable by default because it there is high uncertainty about where such upgrades are feasible, but these optional features allow users to explore the potential and value of increasing hydropower fleet flexibility, which is discussed in detail in <span id="id78">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id576" title="Stuart Cohen and Matthew Mowers. Advanced Hydropower and PSH Capacity Expansion Modeling (Final Report on HydroWIRES D1 Improvements to Capacity Expansion Modeling).

<p>The same WECC ADS database used to define intraannual changes in maximum capacity is used to define region-specific fractional minimum capacity for dispatchable existing and upgrade hydropower in WECC <span id="id79">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2180" title="WECC. Anchor Data Set (ADS) \textbar  Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Technical Report, Western Electricity Coordinating Council, July 2024.">WECC, 2024</a>]</span>. Lacking minimum capacity data for non-WECC regions, 0.5 is chosen as a reasonable fractional minimum capacity.</p>
<p>Both the NPD and NSD resource assessments implicitly assume inflexible, run-of-river hydropower, so all NPD and NSD resource potential is assumed non-dispatchable. Additional site-specific analysis could allow re-categorizing portions of these resources as dispatchable, but 100% non-dispatchable remains the default assumption.</p>

<p>ReEDS can generate electricity from biomass either in dedicated biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants or cofired with coal in facilities that have been retrofitted with an auxiliary fuel feed. These cofire-ready coal plants can use biomass in place of coal to supply the fuel for up to 15% of the plantâs electricity generation. A cofire retrofit costs 305 $2017/kW based on EIAâs Electricity Market Module assumptions <span id="id80">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id833" title="EIA.

Nationally, approximately 116 million dry tons of woody biomass are assumed to be available to the power sector. In addition to the supply curve price (which represents the cost of the resource in the field), ReEDS also assumes costs of $15 per dry ton for collection and harvesting, as well as an additional $15 per dry ton for transport, as based on estimates from a 2014 INL study <span id="id82">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1291" title="J.

<h3>Conventional Energy Technologies<a class="headerlink" href="#conventional-energy-technologies" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>ReEDS includes all major categories of conventional generation technologies within its operating fleet or its investment choices. In the context of ReEDS, âconventionalâ is defined as thermal generating technologies driven by coal, gas, oil, or nuclear fuel. Coal technologies are subdivided into pulverized and gasified (IGCC) categories, with the pulverized plants further distinguished by 1) whether SO<sub>2</sub> scrubbers are installed and 2) their vintage<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref20" id="id84" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>16<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> as pre- or post-1995. Pulverized coal plants have the option of adding a second fuel feed for biomass. New coal plants can be added with or without CCS technology. Existing coal units built after 1995 with SO<sub>2</sub> scrubbers installed also have the option of retrofitting CCS capability.</p>
<p>Natural gas generators are categorized as combustion turbine (CT), combined cycle (CC), or gas-CC with CCS.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref21" id="id85" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>17<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> The natural gas technologies all use the F-frame turbine cost and performance projections from the ATB, with gas-CC using the 2-on-1 configuration and the gas-CC with CCS using the 95% CCS capture projections.</p>
<p>There are also nuclear (steam) generators (large and small-scale), landfill gas generators,<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref22" id="id86" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>18<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> and oil/gas steam generators, though the latter two are not offered as options for new construction besides those that are already under construction. The model distinguishes each conventional-generating technology by costs, efficiency, and operational constraints.</p>
<p>Where renewable energy technologies have many unique characteristics, ReEDS conventional technologies are characterized more generally by the following parameters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Capital cost ($/MW)</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed and variable operating costs (dollars per megawatt-hour [$/MWh])</p></li>
<li><p>Fuel costs (dollars per million British thermal units [$/MMBtu])</p></li>
<li><p>Heat rate (MMBtu/MWh)</p></li>
<li><p>Construction period (years) and expenses</p></li>
<li><p>Equipment lifetime (years)</p></li>
<li><p>Financing costs (such as interest rate, loan period, debt fraction, and debt-service-coverage ratio)</p></li>
<li><p>Tax credits (investment or production)</p></li>
<li><p>Minimum turndown ratio (%)</p></li>
<li><p>Ramp rate (fraction per minute)</p></li>
<li><p>Startup cost ($/MW)</p></li>
<li><p>Planned and unplanned outage rates (%).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cost and performance assumptions for all new conventional technologies are taken from the ATB <span id="id87">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1727" title="NREL. 2024 Annual Technology Baseline. Technical Report, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, 2024.">NREL, 2024</a>]</span> with options for the conservative, moderate, and advanced trajectories from the ATB. Regional variations and adjustments are included and described in the <a class="reference internal" href="#hydrogen"><span class="xref myst">Hydrogen section</span></a>. Fixed operation and maintenance costs for coal and nuclear plants increase over time with the plants age. These escalation factors are taken from the AEO2023.</p>
<p>Within the model, unplanned outages are applied uniformly throughout the year. Planned outages are applied only during the spring and fall months.</p>
<p>In addition to the performance parameters listed above, technologies are differentiated by their ability to provide operating reserves. In general, natural gas plants, especially combustion turbines, are better suited for ramping and reserve provision, while coal and nuclear plants are typically designed for steady operation. See <a class="reference internal" href="#operational-reliability"><span class="xref myst">Operational Reliability</span></a> for more details.</p>
<p>The existing fleet of generators in ReEDS is taken from the NEMS unit database from AEO2023 <span id="id88">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id821" title="EIA. Annual Energy Outlook 2023. Technical Report, U.S. Energy Information Administration, Washington, D.C., March 2023.">EIA, 2023</a>]</span>, with data supplemented from the March 2024 EIA 860M. In particular, ReEDS uses the net summer capacity, net winter capacity,<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref23" id="id89" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>19<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> location, heat rate, variable O&amp;M, and fixed O&amp;M to characterize the existing fleet. ReEDS uses a modified âaverageâ heat rate for any builds occurring after 2010: a technology-specific increase on the full-load heat rate is applied to accommodate for units not always operating at their design point. The modifiers, shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#heat-rate-adjustments"><span class="std std-numref">Table 4</span></a>, are based on the relationship between the reported heat rate the ATB, and the actual observed heat rate, calculated on a fleet-wide basis for each fuel type.</p>

<h3>Storage Technologies<a class="headerlink" href="#storage-technologies" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>ReEDS includes three utility-scale energy storage options<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref26" id="id95" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>22<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>: PSH, batteries, and CAES (hydrogen, which can be considered as a storage technology, is discussed in the next section). All three storage options are capable of load shifting (arbitrage), providing planning and operating reserves, and reducing curtailment of VRE. Generally, load shifting is accomplished by charging the storage or reservoir during inexpensive, low-demand timesteps and discharging at peak times. Although storage is neither directly linked nor assumed co-located with renewable energy technologies in ReEDS (except in the case of PV-storage hybrids; see <a class="reference internal" href="#pvb"><span class="xref myst">PVB</span></a>), it can play an important role in reducing curtailed electricity from variable generation resources by charging during timesteps with excess renewable generation. The ability of storage to reduce curtailment is calculated endogenously. We apply a minimum VOM of $0.01/MWh (in 2004$) to all storage to avoid degeneracy with renewable energy curtailment.</p>
<p>The nameplate capacity of storage can contribute toward planning reserves, though at a potentially reduced rate based on either its capacity credit or its energy availability during stress periods. The contribution of storage toward the reserve margin requirement is discussed further in <a class="reference internal" href="#resource-adequacy"><span class="xref myst">Resource Adequacy</span></a>. Capacity not being used for charge or discharging can also be utilized to provide any of the operating reserves products represented in ReEDS (see <a class="reference internal" href="#electricity-system-operation-and-reliability"><span class="xref myst">Electricity System Operation and Reliability</span></a> on how reserves are differentiated in ReEDS). An energy penalty is associated with storage to provide regulation reserves that reflect losses due to charging and discharging. Storage is also required to have sufficient charge to provide operating reserves in addition to any charge already required for generation in the appropriate timestep.</p>
<p>Storage is represented with a fixed energy/power capacity ratio, characterized by the number of hours (duration) that the battery could discharge at its rated power capacity. The storage technologies can be modified using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_Storage</span></code>. Batteries are primarily represented with durations of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours. The model can also represent long-duration batteries of 12, 24, 48, 72, 100 hour durations, such long duration storageâs accurate modeling will requires temopral resolution selection that allows inter-period linkage, either by choose hourly resolution that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_HourlyType</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">'year'</span></code>, or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_HourlyType</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">'day'</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">'wek'</span></code> with inter-day linkage turned on using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_InterDayLinkage</span></code>. The detail of inter-day linkage can refer to <a class="reference internal" href="#temporal-resolution"><span class="xref myst">Temporal Resolution</span></a>. CAES is assumed to have a duration of 12 hours, and the PSH storage duration is either 8, 10, or 12 hours depending on the chosen PSH supply curve (8 hours being the default).</p>
<p>Existing PSH capacity is represented in the model per the input plant database (see inputs/capacity_exogenous/ReEDS_generator_database_final_EIA-NEMS.csv). New PSH potential is derived from a national PSH resource assessment described in Rosenlieb et al. <span id="id96"><a class="reference internal" href="#id1895" title="Evan Rosenlieb, Donna Heimiller, and Stuart Cohen.

The choice of PSH supply curve in the model is governed by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pshsupplycurve</span></code> switch. There is also an option to require new PSH to purchase water access from water supply curves in order to fill new PSH reservoirs, and this constraint can add cost and further restrict PSH deployment via the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_PSHwatercon</span></code> switch.

<p>ReEDS includes the sole existing CAES facility in Alabama. New CAESÂ site development costs are estimated based on the underground geology, where domal saltÂ is the least costly resource at $1170/kW (22.6 GW available), bedded salt is the next most costly resource at $1,420/kW (37.0 GW), and aquifers (porous rock) are the most costly resource at $1,680/kW (61.6 GW) <span id="id99">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1415" title="Lazard.

This additional fuel input to the electrical power input during compression results in a round-trip efficiency ofÂ 125%. CAES is included as an option in ReEDS, it is turned off by default to reduce model complexity.</p>
<p>Unlike PSH and CAES, utility-scale batteries are not restricted by location-specific resource constraints. Battery cost and performance assumptions are based on lithium-ion battery systems, with costs taken from the 2024 ATB for durations up to 100 hours. Low, mid, and high cost projections are available and scale with the user-defined battery duration. For longer duration batteries (12 hours and above), costs are based on linear extrapolations using the per unit power and energy capacity costs established by the ATB. For all battery durations the cost scenario is set by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">batteryscen</span></code>. An additional switch, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_Storage</span></code>, can be used to limit the model to select durations in order to reduce solve time. In contrast to all other generator technologies in ReEDS which have lifetimes that meet or exceed typical model evaluation windows for book life, the battery is assumed to last 15 years. As a result, its capital cost is uprated by the ratio of a 15-year evaluation window and the evaluation window used by the run. The batteries are assumed to have a round-trip efficiency of 85%. Battery storage has a representative size of 60 MW.</p>

<h3>Hydrogen<a class="headerlink" href="#hydrogen" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>ReEDS has the capability of modeling the use of hydrogen, both as a form of seasonal storage to meet power system requirements and as a clean fuel produced by the power sector for use in other sectors.</p>
<p>In the power sector, hydrogen can be consumed as a fuel in hydrogen combustion turbines (H2-CTs). H2-CTs are comparable to commercial gas turbines but can be fired with hydrogen <span id="id101">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1620" title="Mitsubishi.

Technical Report NREL/TP-6A20-77610, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, October 2020.">Ruth <em>et al.</em>, 2020</a>]</span>. H2-CTs are assumed to have the same heat rate and operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) cost as regular gas-fired combustion turbines (see <a class="reference internal" href="#conventional-energy-technologies"><span class="xref myst">Conventional Energy Technologies</span></a>) but with a 3% higher overnight capital cost, slightly lower than the 10% value reported by Ruth et al. <span id="id102"><a class="reference internal" href="#id1905" title="Mark F.

Technical Report NREL/TP-6A20-77610, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, October 2020.">2020</a></span> in order to allow the H2-CT to be clutched and act as a synchronous generator. Existing gas generators can be upgraded to this H2-CT technology by paying a 33% difference in capital cost between the two generators.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#h2upgrade" id="id103" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>24<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>Power sector hydrogen use is determined by the modelâs optimization; as with natural gas plants and other fuel-based generators, ReEDS weighs the costs of investment in H2-CTs and procuring hydrogen against other options for serving load and meeting other power system constraints. In contrast, demand for hydrogen produced by the power sector but used externally in other sectors is specifically exogenously as an input. This demand is intended to capture hydrogen used in sector such as transportation or industry and can be specified in terms of a total national hydrogen by year.</p>
<p>The model includes a range of options for representing the production, transport and storage or hydrogen, as well as the spatial resolution of at which hydrogen demand is serviced. These options include: (1) as a drop-in renewable fuel with a fixed price, (2) endogenous representation of production with national balancing, and (3) endogenous representation of production with zonal balancing. Each of these representations is discussed in more detail below. By default, the model uses the 3rd option (endogenous representation with zonal balancing), with the interzonal transportation option turned off.</p>
<section id="drop-in-renewable-fuel">
<h4>Drop-in renewable fuel<a class="headerlink" href="#drop-in-renewable-fuel" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>The first approach models hydrogen as a drop-in renewable fuel that is available in unlimited quantity at a fixed price ($/MMBtu). The default fuel costs for this approach are assumed to be $20/MMBtu, which is consistent with estimates of the costs for hydrogen produced using an electrolyzer powered by dedicated wind or PV; for example, Mahone et al. <span id="id104"><a class="reference internal" href="#id1508" title="Amber Mahone, Liz Mettetal, John Stevens, Sharad Bharadwaj, Anthony Fratto, Manohar Mogadali, Vignesh Venugopal, Mengyao Yuan, and Arne Olson. Hydrogen Opportunities in a Low-Carbon Future. Technical Report, Energy and Environmental Economics, Inc., San Francisco, CA, 2020.">2020</a></span> report a range of $7â35/MMBtu. This estimate also falls within the range of current ethanol ($12/MMBtu) and biodiesel ($30/MMBtu) prices <span id="id105">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id730" title="DOE. Alternative Fuel Price Report. Technical Report, U. S. Department of Energy, Washington, D.C., July 2020.">DOE, 2020</a>]</span>. It is also consistent with Hargreaves and Jones <span id="id106"><a class="reference internal" href="#id1144" title="Jeremy J. Hargreaves and Ryan A. Jones.

As this is the only hydrogen cost modeled with this approach, this fuel cost represents an âall-inâ cost that includes the cost of production, delivery, and storage of hydrogen. Users can specify different trajectories for fuel costs over time.</p>
<p>Under the drop-in renewable fuel approach, the use of curtailed renewable energy for H2-CT fuel production is not explicitly considered; to capture this dynamic the production of hydrogen must be endogenously modeled in ReEDS, which is described in the next section.</p>

<p><sup>a</sup> Electrolyzers also pay a stack replacement cost of 60% of the installed capital cost after 10 years of operation. ReEDS assumes that electrolyzer units have a 20 year lifespan and a 10 year electrolyzer stack lifespan, so this cost is paid once over the electrolyzer unitâs lifetime.
<sup>b</sup> operation and maintenance</p>
<p>Under this representation of hydrogen, ReEDS ensures sufficient hydrogen production to match total annual demand at a national level. This means that hydrogen demand from H2-CTs and external sources is represented on an annual basis, and that hydrogen can be produced in any location or time period in the model to serve that demand. Users have the option to apply an adder to the production of hydrogen to represent additional costs of transporting and storing hydrogen (a non-zero cost is included by default), but these are not explicitly represented in this formulation.</p>

<h4>Endogenous production with zonal balancing, transport, and storage<a class="headerlink" href="#endogenous-production-with-zonal-balancing-transport-and-storage" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>In this approach hydrogen production is explicitly represented, but instead of matching hydrogen supply and demand at the national level is matched zonally in each of the modelâs balancing areas. The equation below reflects how for each region <em>r</em> in each time period <em>h</em> the model balances hydrogen supply, which includes production (Prod), storage withdrawals (StorOut), and transfers from neighboring regions <em>rr</em> (Flow), with hydrogen demand, including storage injections (StorIn), transfers to neighboring regions, and demand from H2CTs and other sectors.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}Prod_(h,r) + StorOut_(h,r) + \sum_(rr) Flow_(h,rr,r) \\
= StorIn_(h,r) + \sum_(rr) Flow_(h,rr,r) + H2CT_(h,r) + Exog_(h,r)\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Hydrogen demand from the power sector is attributed to balancing area based on H2-CTs usage, whereas exogenous hydrogen demand is allocated to balancing using regional demand fractions.</p>
<p>To store hydrogen a balancing area must invest in storage capacity. ReEDS currently represents two forms of geological hydrogen storageâeither in salt caverns or hard rock formationsâas well as the ability to construct storage in underground pipe systems. Data on the availability of geological storage are taken from <span id="id107">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1476" title="Anna S. Lord, Peter H. Kobos, and David J. Borns. Geologic storage of hydrogen: Scaling up to meet city transportation demands.

Because of the lack of credible estimates on available reservoir capacity, ReEDS does not impose limits on the amount of storage that a balancing area connected to reservoir can build. However, to ensure that hydrogen combustion turbine dispatch is correctly represented during stress periods the minimum storage duration is set to 24 hours.</p>
<p>Costs of hydrogen storage are based on estimates from <span id="id108">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1777" title="D. D. Papadias and R. K. Ahluwalia. Bulk storage of hydrogen.

For geological storage ReEDS assumes $/kg based on the economies-of-scale from constructing 2-3 caverns. To reduce model complexity, ReEDS assumes that each balancing area can only build the cheapest storage option that it has available to it. ReEDS requires that any hydrogen storage be sized to hold at least 24 hours worth of hydrogen to run the H2-CTs in a given region. This minimum duration helps ensure that the representative year has the storage needed for serving stress periods outside of the representative year.</p>

<h3>Direct Air Capture<a class="headerlink" href="#direct-air-capture" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>The model can also procure negative emissions by removing and storing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere using direct air capture (DAC). DAC in the ReEDS model is represented as a sorbent design that uses only electricity as an input, with an energy consumption of 3.72 MWh per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> removed. Overnight capital costs are assumed to be $1,932 per tonne-year capture capacity, with annual fixed O&amp;M costs of 4.6% of the capital costs and nonfuel variable O&amp;M cost of $21 per tonne.</p>

<p>ReEDS has the option to use a detailed CO<sub>2</sub> network representation that, when turned on, requires all CO<sub>2</sub> captured at CCS facilities (generation-based-CCS, SMR-CCS, and DAC) to be transported via liquid CO<sub>2</sub> pipelines and sequestered in underground saline aquifers. âTrunkâ pipelines can be built between BA transmission endpoints and âspurâ pipelines can be build from BA transmission endpoints to the edge of any nearby (&lt;200 mi) aquifer. These pipelines can be assigned different capital and FO&amp;M costs, and the several hundred saline aquifers identified by NETL have $/tonne breakeven costs that represent the cost of sequestering CO<sub>2</sub> in the aquifer (i.e. permitting, injection facilities, monitoring, and a 100-year trust fund for maintenance).</p>

Units are mapped to ReEDS technologies based on a combination of fuel source and prime mover of the generation technology. Units of the same technology type within a region can be aggregated or represented individually.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref29" id="id113" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>26<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> If they are aggregated, the aggregation is done by clustering the units based on heat rates.</p>
<p>The binning structure is designed flexibly such that users can choose the appropriate levels of model fidelity and computational speed for each application. Historical units are binned using aÂ k-means clustering algorithm for each BA and technology category (e.g., coal with or without SO<sub>2</sub> scrubbers, and natural gas combined cycle) combination. The user specifies a maximum number of bins and a minimum deviation across unit heat rates. Any two plants areÂ eligible to form separate bins if the difference between their heat rates is greater than the minimum deviation parameter. The number of bins formed is then equal to the smaller of the maximum bin number parameter and the number of units after applying the minimum deviation criteria. For each bin, the assigned heat rate is equal to the capacity-weighted average of the heat rates for the units inside the bin. An illustrative example of the results is depicted for two BAs in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-capacity-binning-example"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 31</span></a>, assuming a maximum of seven bins and minimum deviation of 50Â BTU per kWh. The horizontal axis corresponds to the heat rate for a given power plant unit from the NEMS database, while the vertical axis corresponds to the heat rate each bin is assigned in ReEDS. Points on the 45-degree line illustrate units for which the ReEDS heat rate is the same as the NEMS heat rate. The more tightly clustered the points are around this line, the less the model will suffer from aggregation bias. The figure illustrates that, in general, the fewer the number of units in a given technology category (in this example, nuclear and scrubbed coal), the closer the binned heat rates are to the actual heat rates. The aggregation is set by ânumhintageâ in cases.csv, and is set to 6 by default.</p>

<p>Retirements of existing conventional energy generators in ReEDS are primarily a function of announced retirement dates and technology-specific estimated lifetimes, taken from the AEO 2023 NEMS plant database and EIA 860M. Retirement dates of coal plants are further checked and updated in case the EIA 860M does not capture the latest retirement dates. Retirement dates for several nuclear plants, which are not up to date in NEMS and EIA 860M, are mannually updated (Diablo nuclear power plants in CA and Palisades nuclear power plant in MI).

<p>In addition to age-based retirements, ReEDS includes the option to endogenously retire technologies (this option is turned on by default). When doing endogenous retirements, ReEDS is trading off the value provided to the system by the plant versus the costs incurred by keeping the plant online. If the value is not sufficient to recover the costs, ReEDS will choose to retire the plant. ReEDS includes a âretirement frictionâ parameter that allows a plant to stay online as long as it is recovering at least a portion of its fixed operating costs. For example, if this retirement friction parameter is set to 0.5, then a plant will only retire if it does not recover at least half of its fixed costs. Additionally, ReEDS includes a minimum retirement age for existing conventional plants of 20 years, meaning that a conventional plant is not allowed to be endogenously retired until it is at least 20 years old.</p>

<section id="growth-constraints">
<h4>Growth Constraints<a class="headerlink" href="#growth-constraints" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>The ReEDS model can represent either absolute growth constraints (e.g., wind builds cannot exceed 100 GW per year) or relative growth constraints (e.g., wind capacity cannot grow by more than 50% per year). The growth constraints are designed to target a broader technology group as opposed to the individual classes of wind, PV, and CSP; as an example, the growth constraint would restrict the builds of all wind technologies and classes and not just a specific class. The default values for the absolute growth constraints are the highest year-over-year changes of each technology typeâs capacity from 2010 to 2020. For CSP, the default absolute growth limit is assigned the same as PV, as it has not seen the capacity buildout as PV or wind have as of 2020. The relative growth limits are applied on a state-level and are based on historical compounded annual growth rate estimates observed for solar PV from 2012-2022. The penalties are assessed in ReEDS based on the maximum previous growth observed in the model. For example, if a state experienced 1,000 MW of new capacity in 2024 and 500 MW of new capacity in 2025, then the growth penalty would be applied using the 1,000 MW value even though it is older.</p>

<p>Natural gas fuel prices are adjusted by the model as explained below.</p>
<p>Coal and uranium are assumed to be perfectly inelastic; the price is predetermined and insensitive to the ReEDS demand for the fuel. With natural gas, however, the price and demand are linked. Actual natural gas prices in ReEDS are based on the AEO scenario prices but are not exactly the same; instead, they are price-responsive to ReEDS natural gas demand. In each year, each census division is characterized by a price-demand âset pointâ taken from the AEO Reference scenario but also by two elasticity coefficients: regional (Î²<sub>r</sub>) and national (Î²<sub>n</sub>) elasticity coefficients for the rate of regional price change with respect to (1) the change in the regional gas demand from its set-point and (2) the overall change in the national gas demand from the national price-demand set point respectively. The set of regional and national elasticity coefficients are developed through a linear regression analysis across an ensemble of AEO scenarios<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref32" id="id128" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>29<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a><sup>,</sup><a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref33" id="id129" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>30<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> to estimate changes in fuel prices driven solely by electric sector natural gas demand (as described in Logan et al. <span id="id130"><a class="reference internal" href="#id1461" title="Jeffrey Logan, Anthony Lopez, Trieu Mai, Carolyn Davidson, Morgan Bazilian, and Douglas Arent.

Though there is no explicit representation of natural gas demand beyond the electricity sector, the regional supply curves reflect natural gas resource, infrastructure, and nonelectric sector demand assumptions embedded within the AEO modeling.

<p>ReEDS includes options for other types of fuel supply curve representations. Supply curves can be national-only, census-region-only, or static. With the national-only supply curve, there are census division multipliers to adjust prices across the census divisions. In the static case, fuel prices are not responsive to demand.</p>
<p>The natural gas fuel prices also include a seasonal price adjustor, making winter prices higher than the natural gas prices seen during the other seasons of the year.

<h3>Existing Fleet Cooling Technology and Water Source<a class="headerlink" href="#existing-fleet-cooling-technology-and-water-source" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>Thermal generating technologies in ReEDS are differentiated by the following cooling technology types: once-through, recirculating, pond, and dry(air)-cooled. Cooling technologies determine water withdrawal and consumption rates and affect capital cost, operating cost, and heat rate as described in the <a class="reference internal" href="#cooling-system-cost-and-performance"><span class="xref myst">Cooling System Cost and Performance section</span></a>. Generating technologies without cooling systems are designated as having no cooling; however, these technologies can still be assigned water withdrawal and consumption rates to account for processes such as evaporation from hydropower reservoirs or cleaning PV arrays. All power-cooling technology combinations (including water-using technologies without cooling) are also assigned one of the following six water source types included in the model: fresh surface water that is currently appropriated, unassigned/unappropriated fresh surface water, fresh groundwater, brackish or saline groundwater, saline surface water, and wastewater treatment facility effluent. These water source types align with the water supply curves described in <a class="reference internal" href="#water-availability-and-cost"><span class="xref myst">Water Availability and Cost</span></a>. Appropiation of water refers to how water rights are assigned in the western United States, so no regions in the east have appropriated water. Representing both cooling technology and water source allows a high-fidelity representation of water source-sink relationships and constraints by enumerating all available power technology, cooling technology, and water source combinations within the ReEDS technology set.</p>
<p>Cooling technology and water source of the baseline 2010 generation fleet and subsequent prescribed builds is assigned using several data sources mapped to the unit database that exogenously defines capital stock in ReEDS. The EIA NEMS unit database is first merged with the 2018 version of the EIA thermoelectric cooling water dataset <span id="id136">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2136" title="USEIA. Thermoelectric cooling water data. https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/water/, 2018.">USEIA, 2018</a>]</span>. Cooling technology assignment uses the â860 Cooling Type 1â field where possible, followed by the â860 Cooling Type 2â and finally â923 Cooling Typeâ. Hybrid cooling systems are assigned as recirculating except for hybrid dry/induced draft systems, which are assigned as dry cooling. Any remaining gaps in cooling technology assignment are filled using the UCS EW3 Energy-Water Database <span id="id137">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2124" title="Union of Concerned Scientists. UCS EW3 Energy-Water Database V.1.3. www.ucsusa.org/ew3database, 2012.">Union of Concerned Scientists, 2012</a>]</span>. This procedure enables annual updates through yearly reporting of EIA thermoelectric cooling water data. Thermal units with no available information on cooling technology are assigned recirculating cooling by default.</p>
<p>Water source in ReEDS is assigned where possible using the âWater Typeâ and âWater Sourceâ fields in the EIA cooling water dataset and then supplemented using raw EIA Form 860 plant-level data <span id="id138">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id992" title="Form EIA-860 detailed data with previous form data (EIA-860A/860B). https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/, 2018."><em>Form EIA-860 Detailed Data with Previous Form Data (EIA-860A/860B)</em>, 2018</a>]</span>. When the water source is unclear from the type and source, the âWater Source Nameâ is used to help discern additional water source types and determine which units use municipal water. Municipal water is treated as an intermediary of the ultimate water source, which is defined using U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) water use data for 2015 that includes water sources for municipal use <span id="id139">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id718" title="Cheryl A. Dieter and Kristin S. Linsey. Estimated Use of Water in the United States County-Level Data for 2015. 2017. doi:10.5066/F7TB15V5.">Dieter and Linsey, 2017</a>]</span>. Generating units that use municipal water are assigned the water source that supplies the majority of municipal water use in the USGS database. The UCS EW3 database is also used to assign water sources unavailable in EIA data <span id="id140">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2124" title="Union of Concerned Scientists. UCS EW3 Energy-Water Database V.1.3. www.ucsusa.org/ew3database, 2012.">Union of Concerned Scientists, 2012</a>]</span>. Remaining unknown water source types are assigned from USGS data using the majority water source for the power sector, further differentiated by once-through or recirculating cooling. If there is no USGS data for power sector water use in the relevant county, the majority source of overall water use is applied.</p>
<p>Beyond this multi-database approach to assign cooling technology and water source, water source must be reassigned for some prescribed new builds if the water availability described in <a class="reference internal" href="#water-availability-and-cost"><span class="xref myst">Water Availability and Cost</span></a> is insufficient for that unitâs water needs. For these instances, a final adjustment procedure that temporary relaxes water use constraints is used to identify these units and manually modify water source types to use the BAâs least-cost water source with sufficient availability for the prescribed unit.</p>

<section id="cooling-system-cost-and-performance">
<h3>Cooling System Cost and Performance<a class="headerlink" href="#cooling-system-cost-and-performance" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>Alternative cooling technologies are represented for the following power system types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Coal: all types, including coal with CCS and biomass-cofired coal</p></li>
<li><p>Gas-CC: including Gas-CC with CCS</p></li>
<li><p>Oil-Gas-Steam: also allows âno coolingâ to represent capacity that does not use thermal cooling water (e.g., internal combustion engines)</p></li>
<li><p>Nuclear</p></li>
<li><p>Biopower: also allows âno coolingâ to represent capacity that does not use thermal cooling water</p></li>
<li><p>Landfill Gas: also allows âno coolingâ to represent capacity that does not use thermal cooling water</p></li>
<li><p>CSP: all thermal storage durations and resource classes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Water use is also characterized and constrained for hydropower, Gas-CT, geothermal, and distributed rooftop PV technologies, albeit without cooling technology disaggregation. This construct allows total power sector water use to be estimated and enables expansion in later model versions, particularly for geothermal technologies.</p>
<p>Some power-cooling technology pairs are also prohibited for new construction by default. New, non-prescribed capacity for all technologies cannot use once-through cooling due to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations and industry trends <span id="id141">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id893" title="EPA. 40 CFR Parts 122 and 125. Technical Report Vol. 79, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2014.">EPA, 2014</a>]</span>. In addition, all new non-prescribed capacity cannot choose pond cooling because pond cooling designs are site-dependent, and ReEDS does not have sufficient detail to characterize location-specific cooling pond design. The model also prevents new nuclear and coal-CCS capacity from using dry cooling because existing designs have very high cooling requirements where dry cooling is considered impractical. These restrictions can be relaxed with minor code modifications.</p>
<p>Cooling technology affects capital cost, variable operating cost, heat rate, water withdrawal rate, and water consumption rate. Cost and heat rate are adjusted for cooling technology by multiplying baseline technology data by the factors in <a class="reference internal" href="#capital-cost-multipliers"><span class="std std-numref">Table 12</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#variable-operations-capital-cost-multipliers"><span class="std std-numref">Table 13</span></a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="#heat-rate-multipliers"><span class="std std-numref">Table 14</span></a>. Recirculating cooling is the reference cooling technology except for CSP, where dry cooling is the reference technology <span id="id142">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1500" title="J. Macknick, R. Newmark, G. Heath, and K. C. Hallett. Operational water consumption and withdrawal factors for electricity generating technologies: a review of existing literature. Environmental Research Letters, 7(4):045802, 2012. doi:10.1088/1748-9326/7/4/045802.">Macknick <em>et al.</em>, 2012</a>]</span>. Typically, once-through cooling systems are less expensive and allow higher overall thermal efficiency, while dry cooling is more expensive and results in lower net thermal efficiency. Pond cooling systems are typically intermediate to once-through and recirculating cooling, but the model uses once-through cooling characteristics as an approximation because actual cost and performance is site-specific. No data exists for some power-cooling technology combinations (Gas-CC-CCS + once-through and pond; Coal-CCS + pond, CSP + once-through and pond) because no existing or planned units of those types exist.</p>

<h3>Water Availability and Cost<a class="headerlink" href="#water-availability-and-cost" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>When water constraints are active, all generating capacity that exists in a given model year is required to have access to water if that technology uses water. The quantity of required water access is defined conservatively to ensure sufficient water is available to generate at maximum power output during the expected annual low water flow condition. To align with annualized water availability data, this requirement is formulated as the annual volume of water needed to operate continuously at maximum output for the entire year (100% capacity factor), i.e., the product of generating capacity (MW), water use rate (gal/MWh), and 8760 hours per year. For capacity that uses surface water, water access requirements are based on the water consumption rate to account for the return of most withdrawn water directly to the water source at the site of withdrawal. For all other water sources, requirements are based on withdrawal rates, since these water types (e.g., groundwater, saline surface water, wastewater effluent) are not generally returned to the site of withdrawal.</p>
<p>Generating capacity in the initial 2010 model year is assumed to have secured sufficient water access prior to 2010. However, any new prescribed or optimized investments must procure water access from a power sector water availability supply curve developed by Sandia National Laboratories <span id="id144">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2082" title="Vincent C. Tidwell, Barbie D. Moreland, Calvin R. Shaneyfelt, and Peter Kobos. Mapping water availability, cost and projected consumptive use in the eastern United States with comparisons to the west.

For use in ReEDS, water availability and cost are aggregated to the BA resolution for each of five water source types: fresh surface water that is currently appropriated, unassigned/unappropriated fresh surface water, fresh groundwater, brackish or saline groundwater, and wastewater treatment facility effluent. Saline surface water is available to existing capacity that currently uses it but is assumed unavailable to new capacity due to current regulatory constraints and industry expectations <span id="id145">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id893" title="EPA. 40 CFR Parts 122 and 125.

Costs include both capital and annualized operating costs associated with each water source. Unassigned/unappropriated fresh surface water is assumed to have negligible access cost, and costs typically increase in the order of fresh groundwater, appropriated fresh surface water, wastewater, and brackish/saline groundwater. Appropriated water is only relevant to western U.S. water law, so there is no appropriated water in the east, and many western regions lack unappropriated water (i.e., 100% of total water is appropriated).</p>
<p>Total water available to the power sector is the sum of the supply curve for new capacity and the initially assumed water availability based on the water use of the fleet in the initial 2010 model year. Thus, when generating capacity retires, its water access is automatically available to any new capacity at the cost associated with the capacityâs water source type and region. For the initial 2010 fleet, all capacity that uses fresh surface water is designated as using the âappropriated fresh surface waterâ category so that retired water access is assigned the cost of other appropriated water in that region. For the eastern U.S. where water appropriation is inapplicable, retired fresh surface water access is assigned a small nominal cost to avoid over procurement of water in the model. This structure implies that any water access owned by the power sector remains in the power sector and that increased competition within or outside the power sector does not affect water supply or cost. Scenario analysis and future model development could explore this assumption in greater detail.</p>
<p>Similar to retirements, changes in water needs due to upgrades or refurbishments are also accounted for in the water access requirement. This is particularly relevant to CCS upgrades, which substantially increase water use rates given the CCS technologies assumed in the model.</p>

<h3>Water Constraints<a class="headerlink" href="#water-constraints" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>Several model constraints govern the ReEDS power sector water use formulation. Water withdrawal and consumption quantities are tracked for each power technology, cooling technology, water source, power technology vintage, BA, timeslice, and year, providing high resolution with which to examine power sector water use. Separately, water access requirements are related explicitly to the capacity available for each power technology, cooling technology, water source, power technology vintage, BA, and year based on either the withdrawal or consumption rate as described in the <a class="reference internal" href="#water-availability-and-cost"><span class="xref myst">Water Availability and Cost section</span></a>. This water access is then limited by the total access available for each water source and region as defined by the water allocation in 2010 and the supply available to post-2010 capacity.</p>
<p>Quantities of water used for each power technology, cooling technology, water source, power technology vintage, and BA are then constrained within each representative day based on an assumed quarterly (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall) allocation of available water access and the relative weight of each quarter in each representative day. Water access must be purchased from the water availability supply curve before water can be used. Hydrology data is used to define the quarterly allocation of unassigned/unappropriated fresh surface water <span id="id147">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1501" title="Jordan Macknick, Stuart Cohen, Robin Newmark, Andrew Martinez, Patrick Sullivan, and Vince Tidwell.

Additional resolution for intraannual water allocation or the potential for changes over time requires additional data, but the framework generally allows the capability to incentivize water sources that are more available when electricity demands are higher.</p>

<h2>Transmission<a class="headerlink" href="#transmission" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h2>
<p>ReEDS considers two categories of transmission: âlocal interconnectionâ of generation resources within the 134 model zones, and âinterzonalâ or âlong-distanceâ transmission between the model zones. These two categories of transmission share underlying cost data but are represented differently within the model. We begin with a discussion of transmission costs, then describe the separate representations of âinterconnectionâ and âlong-distanceâ transmission within ReEDS.</p>

For a given wind/solar site (the ~50,000 reV supply curve points discussed above), substations within the same state are considered as possible POIs. Least-cost paths are calculated to all candidate substations, and the substation with the lowest resulting path-dependent spur-line cost is taken as the POI for that wind/solar site. An appropriate spur-line voltage is chosen based on the available wind or solar capacity at that site, with lower available capacity leading to a lower spur-line voltage and a higher associated $/MW-mile cost. The cost of upgrading the POI substation is included in the spur-line cost. Additional sources and details are provided by Lopez et al <span id="id150"><a class="reference internal" href="#id1469" title="Anthony Lopez, Wesley Cole, Brian Sergi, Aaron Levine, Jesse Carey, Cailee Mangan, Trieu Mai, Travis Williams, Pavlo Pinchuk, and Jianyu Gu.

<h4>Network reinforcement<a class="headerlink" href="#network-reinforcement" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>Network reinforcement represents upgrades to the existing transmission network required to avoid congestion when moving power from the POI to load centers. It is intended to represent the costs associated with interconnection queues, which represent a major bottleneck for the deployment of new wind and solar in the US. We estimate network reinforcement costs by tracing a path along existing transmission lines from each substation POI to each zone âcenterâ within the same state; the zone center is usually taken as the largest population center in the model zone, but is sometimes (for zones without large urban centers) assigned to a high-voltage substation within the zone. A cost for each reinforcement route is calculated using the cost surface described in <a class="reference internal" href="#transmission-costs"><span class="xref myst">Transmission costs</span></a>, with capex costs multiplied by 50% to represent the lower cost for reconductoring compared to greenfield transmission construction. The single lowest-cost route for each POI is then selected; the associated reinforcement cost \$/MW] and transmission distance \MW-miles] are incurred for every MW of new wind/solar capacity added at all reV sites associated with that POI.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref34" id="id151" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>31<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

<p>Short description of ITL paper</p>
<p>The transmission network in ReEDS is a synthetic network developed from nodal data assembled as part of the North American Renewable Integration Study (NARIS) [37]. This dataset relies on nodal transmission models developed for the Eastern, Western, and ERCOT interconnections under the guidance of the North American Reliability Corporation (NERC) and includes ~56,000 buses, ~94,000 transmission lines, and ~37,000 transformers. Capacity expansion models, such as ReEDS, typically use zonal representation to remain tractable, forgoing the modeling of individual generation, consumption, or transmission assets and instead grouping them into zones which are treated as copper plates. Assigning generation and demand units to their respective zones is intuitive, however deriving the transmission topology from the resolved nodal data is more involved than aggregating steady state rated capacity across zonal interfaces due to the physics of electrical power flow in meshed networks. In <span id="id153">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id458" title="Patrick R. Brown, Clayton P. Barrows, Jarrad G. Wright, Gregory L. Brinkman, Sourabh Dalvi, Jiazi Zhang, and Trieu Mai. A general method for estimating zonal transmission interface limits from nodal network data. August 2023. arXiv:2308.03612.">Brown <em>et al.</em>, 2023</a>]</span> the authors propose a method for estimating the interface transfer limits between zones from nodal transmission data utilizing a DC power flow approximation. In this approach two independent optimizations are performed to maximize the sum of flows in the forward direction on the transmission lines crossing the interface and to minimize the sum of flows in the reverse direction crossing the interface. The power flow is constrained by the line ratings as described in (5).</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[-k(l) \le F(l) \le k(l) \]</div>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>The relationship between line flows and bus injections or withdrawals is dictated by the power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) matrix described in (6). The PTDF relates the change in transaction amount (amount of power injected at one zone and withdrawn in another zone) to the change in power flow on a line. For instance, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_{}\)</span> represents that fraction of power transferred from zone <em>m</em> to zone <em>n</em> that flows over a transmission line connecting zone <em>i</em> and zone <em>j.</em></p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[F(l) \sum_{b}^{B} p(l,b)G(b) \quad \forall l\]</div>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>Additional constraints are applied to individual buses for which bus type data are available, limiting injections for load buses and withdrawals for generation buses, and both injections and withdrawals for transmission buses. In conjunction these constraints establish a more stringent limit for interface transfer capacities as compared to the approach which sums the line ratings across interfaces. This method for deriving interface transfer limits is used to create the transmission networks in both the default BA resolution of ReEDS. At the BA resolution the optimization is run within each U.S. interconnection separately as they operate nearly independently due to limited transfer capacity <span id="id154">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id409" title="Aaron Bloom, Josh Novacheck, Greg Brinkman, James McCalley, Armando Figueroa-Acevedo, Ali Jahanbani-Ardakani, Hussam Nosair, Abhinav Venkatraman, Jay Caspary, Dale Osborn, and Jessica Lau.

<h3>Transmission System<a class="headerlink" href="#transmission-system" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>ReEDS uses a synthetic network with 134 nodes defined by roughly 300 corridors for the contiguous 48 states. Each corridor has a nominal carrying capacity limit that is determined for the start-year (2010) based on power-flow analysis using ABBâs GridView model and NERC-reported line limits <span id="id157">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1678" title="NERC. 2010 Long-term reliability assessment. Technical Report, North American Electric Reliability Corporation, October 2010.">NERC, 2010</a>]</span>. The carrying capacity of DC transmission connections are taken from project websites. A few notable DC transmission connections that areÂ modeled in ReEDS are listed in <a class="reference internal" href="#dc-transmission-connections"><span class="std std-numref">Table 18</span></a>.</p>
<p>In later years, ReEDS can expand these carrying capacities, though the model cannot build new node-to-node pathways. Transmission expansion is limited before 2022 based on new construction that is already planned <span id="id158">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id237" title="ABB. ABB Velocity Suite. https://new.abb.com/enterprise-software/energy-portfolio-management/market-intelligence-services/velocity-suite, 2013.">ABB, 2013</a>]</span>. After 2022, that limitation is dropped. ReEDS constrains transmission flows in each of the representative time-slices when dispatching generation and contracting operating reserves, and available transmission capacity can also be used for firm power contracts to meet system adequacy needs.</p>

<p>In general, the modeled nodes are located at the largest population center of each BA, although some manual adjustments are made.[ref^35] Distances between BA nodes are estimated by tracing the âshortest pathâ distance along existing transmission lines, giving preference for the trace follow higher voltage lines. Voltages for each transmission line were defined using the Homeland Security Infrastructure Project (HSIP) transmission database and converted into 1-km grid. The maximum voltage in each grid cell was identified and assigned a weight based on the voltage classification per <a class="reference internal" href="#voltage-class-weights"><span class="std std-numref">Table 19</span></a> to create a tension grid. Using this tension grip, a least âcostâ (lowest weight) path was traced between every BA-to-BA corridor was determined using the tension grid. Finally, the great circle formula is used to calculate the distance of the traced paths. The lengths of DC corridors are taken from values reported on project websites.</p>

<p>Transmission network flows in ReEDS are limited based on the nominal carrying capacity of theÂ corridors. ReEDS can choose to build additional transmission capacity on the existing network to reduce congestion, but expansion of AC-DC-AC interconnection ties are not allowed under default assumptions. New long-distance HVDC lines are not allowed by default, but can be specified in the model inputs. ReEDS does not represent reactive power and does not address AC-power-flow issues of voltage, frequency, or limiting phase angle differences. Intra-BA T&amp;D networks are similarly ignored, effectively ignoring the effects of transmission congestion within each region.</p>
<p>Transmission and distribution losses are considered in the model. There are bulk transmission losses of 1% per 100 miles for power that flows between BAs. In addition, distribution losses of 5% are assumed and thus added to the end-use demand (<a class="reference internal" href="#electricity-load"><span class="xref myst">Electricity Load</span></a>) to scale end-use demand to busbar load. Distribution losses do not apply to rooftop PV, as they are assumed to be downstream within distribution networks (<a class="reference internal" href="#electricity-load"><span class="xref myst">Electricity Load</span></a>).</p>

<h3>Electricity Load<a class="headerlink" href="#electricity-load" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>The primary constraint in ReEDS is to serve electricity load in each hour and model region. The end-use electricity load projection used in ReEDS is exogenously defined. There are many exogenous load profiles available in the model, designed to accommodate various study needs and sensitivities. Especially as the electrification of non-electric energy uses creates significant regional and temporal shifts to the electric sector load representation, the choice of load profile is important as it contributes to the technology deployment mix and quantity.</p>

<p>The newest load profile addition to the model is the adoption of load profiles from Evolved Energy Research (EER) which feature the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act. EERâs EnergyPATHWAYS model has been the source of previous ReEDS load profiles, as described in the <a class="reference internal" href="#electrification-futures-study-load-profiles"><span class="xref myst">Electrification Futures Study Load Profiles section</span></a>. It uses a bottom-up methodology, building load profiles for each end-use sector before aggregating them together, yielding an hourly, state, subsector level load profile. Their results were disaggregated to the ReEDS BA level and aggregated to reflect total end-use load in the ReEDS model. The default load profile in ReEDS Version 2023 âreflects relatively conservative assumptions about the impact of demand-side provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (relative, compared to other scenarios developed by EER)â <span id="id161">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1030" title="Pieter Gagnon, An Pham, Wesley Cole, Sarah Awara, Anne Barlas, Maxwell Brown, Patrick Brown, Vincent Carag, Stuart Cohen, Anne Hamilton, Jonathan Ho, Sarah Inskeep, Akash Karmakar, Luke Lavin, Anthony Lopez, Trieu Mai, Joseph Mowers, Matthew Mowers, Caitlin Murphy, Paul Pinchuk, Anna Schleifer, Brian Sergi, Daniel Steinberg, and Travis Williams. 2023 Standard Scenarios Report: A U.S. Electricity Sector Outlook.

<p>The end-use load, described in the previous paragraph, is defined at the meter level. ReEDS includes inter-BA transmission system losses in the optimization but does not represent distribution losses, so the end-use load must be scaled up to busbar load to account for distribution losses.

ReEDS is required to generate sufficient power in each time-slice and BA (allowing for transmission of power but accounting for losses) to meet this busbar load.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref37" id="id164" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>33<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

<h4>Load Adjustment Method for End Use Profiles<a class="headerlink" href="#load-adjustment-method-for-end-use-profiles" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>ReEDS includes a methodology to incorporate changes to hourly electric load shapes derived from analysis of other modeling tools. Regional hourly load changes are paired with a defined regional adoption trajectory for this load change by year. Combining these two factors allows for ReEDS to changes to load profiles specific to region, year, and hour. A further unique capability of this method is that an arbitrary number of load changes and adoption trajectories can be provided allowing for sophisticated changes to load shapes with a small number of provided parameters.</p>

<section id="resource-adequacy">
<h3>Resource Adequacy<a class="headerlink" href="#resource-adequacy" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>Resource adequacy is âthe ability of supply- and demand-side resources to meet the aggregate electrical demandâ <span id="id166">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1687" title="NERC. Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards. Technical Report, North American Electric Reliability Corporation, 2016.">NERC, 2016</a>]</span>. Planning reserve requirements in ReEDS ensure adequate resource is available at all times, within an acceptable probability of failing to do so. In practice, this constraint is enforced by requiring the system to have sufficient firm capacity to meet the forecasted peak demand plus a reserve margin. This constraint is enforced for each season to accommodate the potential for peak net load to shift seasons as renewable penetration increases.</p>
<p>The following sections describe the two methods available in ReEDS for ensuring resource adequacy. The second method (stress periods) is currently the default, though the capacity credit formulation is still used for many county-level runs due to challenges with stress periods when operating at county resolution.</p>
<section id="capacity-credit-formulation">
<h4>Capacity credit formulation<a class="headerlink" href="#capacity-credit-formulation" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p><strong>VRE Capacity Credit</strong></p>
<p>For VRE technologies (i.e., wind and solar), ReEDS estimates a seasonal capacity credit for each region/class combination via an hourly LDC approximation of expected load carrying capability (ELCC)<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref40" id="id167" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>34<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> performed between solve years.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref41" id="id168" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>35<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> ELCC can be described as the amount of additional load that can be accommodated by adding those generators while maintaining a constant reliability level. The â8760-basedâ methodology can capture the highest load and net load hours, which typically represent the highest risk hours, and can thereby support a reasonable representation of capacity credit. Details of this LDC approach, as well as a comparison against aÂ former statistical method, can be found in Frew et al. <span id="id169"><a class="reference internal" href="#id1004" title="Bethany Frew, Wesley Cole, Yinong Sun, James Richards, and Trieu Mai. 8760-Based Method for Representing Variable Generation Capacity Value in Capacity Expansion Models.

International Energy Workshop.">2017</a></span>, though that approach has been expanded to consider 7 years of wind, solar, and load data (2007-2013) rather than just a single year.</p>
<p>The LDC approach for calculating capacity credit is based on explicit hourly (8,760 hours x 7 years) tracking of time-synchronous load and VRE resources. The capacity method uses a capacity factor proxy that is applied to top 10 hours in load and net load-duration curves (LDCs and NLDCs) in each season to estimate ELCC by season. <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-cv-calculation-ldc-approach"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 46</span></a> graphically represents the ReEDS capacity credit methodology. The LDC reflects the total load in a given modeling region, which is sorted from the hours of highest load to lowest load and is shown by the blue line. The NLDC represents the total load minus the time-synchronous contribution of VRE, where the resulting net load is then sorted from highest to lowest, as shown by the solid red line.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref42" id="id170" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>36<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> The NLDC(Î´), which represents further addition of VRE resources, can be created by subtracting theÂ time-synchronous generation of an incremental capacity addition from the NLDC, where the resulting time series is again sorted from highest to lowest; this is shown by the dashed red line.</p>

<p>ReEDS calculates the ELCC as the difference in the areas between the LDC and NLDC during the top 10 hours of the duration curves in each season, as represented by the dark blue shaded area in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-cv-calculation-ldc-approach"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 46</span></a>. These 10 hours are a proxy for the hours with the highest risk for loss of load (i.e., the LOLP).<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref43" id="id171" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>37<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> Similarly, the contribution of an additional unit of capacity to meeting peak load is the difference in the areas between the NLDC and the NLDC(Î´), as shown by the light blue shaded area in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-cv-calculation-ldc-approach"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 46</span></a>. To ensure resource adequacy, ReEDS calculates capacity credit based on a 1,000-MW incremental capacity size of new solar and wind builds. These areas are then divided by the corresponding installed capacity and number of top hours (10 hours per season in this case, although the number of hours can be adjusted by the user) to obtain a fractional seasonal-based capacity credit.</p>
<p>The resulting existing and marginal capacity credit<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref44" id="id172" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>38<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> values then feed into ReEDS to quantify each VRE resourceâs capacity contribution to the planning reserve requirement. Existing VRE capacity credit calculations are performed by region and technology. For all candidate VRE resources that might be built in the coming year, the <em>marginal</em> capacity credit is calculated by region, technology, and resource class. In all cases, the VRE profile is compared against the aggregated resource assessment region (RAR) load profile for determining the capacity credit (<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-cv-calculation-ldc-approach"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 46</span></a>). We use the RAR-level load profile to simplify the challenge of representing the ability of transmission to wheel VRE capacity from one BA to another. Essentially, we assume a copper plate within each RAR for theÂ purpose of sharing VRE capacity. We use RAR regions rather than NERC regions for this assumption because transmission and trading tend to be more closely related to RAR regions than NERC regions.</p>
<p><strong>Storage Capacity Credit</strong></p>
<p>The storage capacity credit method in ReEDS characterizes the increase in storage duration that is needed to serve peak demand as a function of storage penetration. The potential of storage to serve peak demand is considered by performing several simulated dispatches against the load profiles within each of the resource assessment regions shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-cv-calculation-ldc-approach"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 46</span></a>.</p>
<p>Load profiles net of wind and PV generation are used to capture the effects of VRE resources on the overall net load profile shape in a region using the load, wind, and solar data from 2007-2013.</p>
<p>For each season and reliability assessment zone, a storage dispatch is simulated with peaking capacity prioritized over all other services (reflecting capacity market prioritization as discussed by Sioshansi, et al. <span id="id173"><a class="reference internal" href="#id1982" title="Ramteen Sioshansi, Seyed Hossein Madaeni, and Paul Denholm. A Dynamic Programming Approach to Estimate the Capacity Value of Energy Storage. IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 29(1):395â403, January 2014. doi:10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2279839.">2014</a></span>).Transmission constraints are ignored within each reliability assessment zone for computational efficiency; this copper plate transmission assumption only applies to the capacity credit calculationâall transmission constraints are enforced in the actual planning reserve margin constraint and other system planning and operation modelling in ReEDS. Optimal coordination of dispatch among energy storage resources is also assumed. The transmission and coordination assumptions together allow for all storage within a reliability assessment zone to be represented as a single aggregate resource. The round-trip efficiency of this aggregated storage resource is assumed to be equal to the energy-capacity-weighted average round-trip efficiency of all installed storage capacity in that region.</p>
<p>All round-trip efficiency losses are included in storage charging. For example, a storage resource with a round-trip efficiency of 85% and a power capacity of 10,000 MW can dispatch 10,000 MW to the grid for 1 hour using 10,000 MWh of energy capacity. However, when the same resource draws 10,000 MW from the grid for 1 hour, its state-of-charge increases by only 8,500Â MWh.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#figure-energy-capacity-requirements-for-storage"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 47</span></a> illustrates the dispatch and calculation of the energy requirement for 5,000 MW of storage to receive full capacity credit in the NYISO region in 2020. First, the storage power capacity is subtracted from the peak load to set a net load maximum. Storage is required to discharge whenever the load profile exceeds this maximum, to ensure the peak net load (load minus storage in this example) is equal to the peak load minus the power capacity of the storage device. The storage is allowed to charge at all other times while ensuring the load maximum is not exceeded.</p>

A depth of discharge of 0 indicates that the storage is full.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#figure-energy-capacity-requirements-for-storage" title="Link to this image">ï</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This dispatch is then used to calculate the energy requirement for storage to receive full capacity credit. At the beginning of the season, the state-of-charge of storage within the region is assumed to be full. The state-of-charge (or depth of discharge, as it is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-energy-capacity-requirements-for-storage"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 47</span></a>) is tracked over the course of the time-series with the maximum depth of discharge left unconstrained. This means the maximum depth of discharge value over the course of the season is equal to the amount of energy capacity that is needed for storage to receive full capacity credit. Dividing this energy by the power capacity used produces the minimum fleet-wide average duration (hours) for storage to receive full capacity credit. In the example in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-energy-capacity-requirements-for-storage"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 47</span></a>, 5,000 MW of peak demand reduction from storage would require 47,000 MWh of energy to receive full capacity credit, or a duration of 9.4 hours.</p>
<p>We repeat this process in each region for each season over a large range of storage power capacities (from 0% to 90% of peak demand in 100-MW increments). The result of each dispatch is used to produce the âpower-energy curveâ in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-storage-peak-capacity-determination"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 48</span></a>, which allows us to calculate the marginal capacity credit for additional storage. The curve gives storage energy capacity that is required for full capacity credit as a function of storage penetration.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref45" id="id174" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>39<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> At any point along the curve, the slope of the tangent to the curve represents the number of hours needed for marginal storage to receive full capacity credit. The incremental capacity credit of an additional unit of storage is equal to the duration of the additional unit installed divided by the duration requirement (slope) at the point on the curve corresponding to the installed storage penetration.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#figure-storage-peak-capacity-determination"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 48</span></a> also illustrates how we create a more tractable solution by reducing the number of combinations considered. Storage in ReEDS is considered in several discrete durations, and these discrete durations are used to define the requirements needed to receive full capacity credit. Instead of a continuous function represented by the constantly varying slope of the power-energy curve, we create several discrete peak duration âbinsâ representing duration requirements. We start by plotting a line with constant slope equal to the shortest duration considered and find where it intersects with the power-energy curve. Then, starting from that point, we plot a line with the next shortest duration and find the point where it intersects with the power-energy curve, and so on, until we have obtained the cumulative limit for each discrete duration of storage to serve peak demand.</p>
<p>As an example, the first segment (having a slope of two) requires two hours to provide full capacity credit, even though it may be physically possible for some small amount of storage with a duration less than two hours to receive full capacity credit. In this example, at the point where 4,309 of 2-hour storage has been added, the lines intersect and the interpolation shifts to a slope of 4 hours, so a device with 4 hours is now required to achieve full capacity credit. The model is still allowed to build 2 hours storage, but it will only receive a 50% (2/4) capacity credit, or the duration of the installed storage device divided by the discrete peak duration âbinâ. At each point, the marginal capacity credit is calculated by the physical capacity of the incremental unit, divided by the discrete duration requirement slope at any point along the curve.</p>
<p>The limit for each duration to serve peak demand from <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-storage-peak-capacity-determination"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 48</span></a> is passed back to the ReEDS model, and the model optimizes the capacity credit of all storage (existing and new investments) together. One advantage of this is that it informs the model of when the capacity credit of storage should go up or down in response to changes in the net load profile shape. Another advantage is that total storage peaking capacity can be assessed in conjunction with other services storage can provide such as curtailment recovery, energy arbitrage, and operating reserves<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref46" id="id175" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>40<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>, and a least-cost solution can be obtained overall.</p>
<p>Building on the results in the example above, <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-installed-battery-capacity"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 49</span></a> shows the actual installed capacities in ERCOT from the low battery cost sensitivity scenario (discussed further in the results section). For each battery storage duration available to the model, installed battery capacity as well as the resource adequacy contribution determined by the model are shown. This resource adequacy contribution is the result of the model optimizing all grid services storage can provide, with capacity credit of all storage subject to the constraints of the peaking capacity limits from <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-storage-peak-capacity-determination"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 48</span></a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>This dynamic assessment of storage capacity credit enables the model to identify the limitations of energy storage to provide peaking capacity. It allows the model to identify the benefits, if they exist, of deploying short-duration resources at reduced capacity credit for energy arbitrage purposes or other grid services captured in the model. Alternatively, the model is also free to deploy longer-duration storage even when shorter durations would receive full capacity credit if this leads to a least-cost solution for meeting all grid services. It also allows the model to respond to changes in net load shape from wind and PV deployment. The capacity credit of storage can change from one solve year to the next as a result of these net load profile shape changes.</p>
<p>Peaking capacity potential for longer durations of storage are also assessed within the model. The potential for 12- and 24-hour storage is included in the assessments described in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-energy-capacity-requirements-for-storage"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 47</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-storage-peak-capacity-determination"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 48</span></a>. This is meant to accommodate the potential to derate the capacity credit of ten-hour batteries and capture the capacity credit of PSH (assumed to have an 8-hour duration by default) and compressed-air energy storage (assumed to have a 12-hour duration).</p>
<p>After this potential is determined, the actual storage capacity credit in ReEDS is determined within the optimization. The durations of storage devices that are installed by the model are evaluated based on the peaking capacity potential of storage (<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-energy-capacity-requirements-for-storage"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 47</span></a>). When determining the contribution of storage toward resource adequacy, two constraints were added to the model to make the capacity credit of storage dynamic and flexible to the many changes in the system that can affect storage capacity credit. The constraints for the formulation of storage capacity credit in ReEDS are as follows:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\sum_{pd}^{}{C_{pd,id} = C_{id}}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\sum_{id}^{}{C_{pd,id}*{cc}_{pd,id} \leq L_{pd}}\]</div>
<p>where L is the limit of peaking storage capacity (i.e. the megawatt values from Figure 5), C is the installed storage capacity, id is the duration of installed storage, pd is the duration of the peak demand contribution being considered, and cc is the capacity credit of an installed duration (id) of storage when applied to a specific peaking duration (pd). Storage capacity credit is equal to installed duration / peak duration, with a maximum of 1. For each duration of installed storage id, its capacity can contribute to any duration of peak demand pd, but the total installed storage capacity C<sub>id</sub> must be equal to the sum of its contributions toward each duration of peak demand. And for each duration of peak demand pd, the total contribution of each installed duration id of storage capacity (adjusted for their capacity credit cc) cannot exceed the limit of peaking storage capacity L of that pd.</p>
<p>For example, consider a simple example where there is 100 MW of peaking storage potential for each storage duration considered in ReEDS: two, four, six, eight, ten, 12, and 24 hours. In this example, 200 MW of two-hour storage, 100 MW of four-hour storage, and 50 MW of six-hour storage are already installed. The model would optimize the capacity credit of storage by giving 100 MW of two-hour storage full capacity credit for its two-hour contribution, the 100 MW of four-hour storage full capacity credit for its four-hour contribution, and the 50 MW of six-hour storage full capacity credit for its six-hour contribution (<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-storage-capacity-credit-allocation-example"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 50</span></a>). In this example, the peaking potential limit of two- and four-hour storage have been reached, so the remaining 100 MW of two-hour storage would receive a capacity credit of 1/3 and contribute 33.3 MW for its six-hour peak demand contribution. The model could then build 16.7 MW of six-hour storage at full capacity credit, at which point the potential for six-hour storage to meet peak demand would be reached as well. The model would then be able to build two-, four-, or six-hour storage at a derated capacity credit with their contribution going toward the eight-hour peak demand âbin,â or it could build 8-hour storage with full capacity credit.</p>

<p>Now consider the same example but in addition to the two-, four-, and six-hour storage installed, there is also 300 MW of PSH in this region with a 12-hour duration (<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-storage-capacity-credit-allocation-example2"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 51</span></a>). The potential for 12-hour storage to serve peak demand is only 100 MW. Rather than giving the remaining 200 MW of PSH a capacity credit of Â½ for its contribution to the 24-hour peak demand period, it is optimal for the model to fill the 10- and 8-hour peak demand âbinsâ with the remaining PSH capacity at full capacity credit since there is no other storage allocated to those peak demand periods. Now, after the model builds 16.7 MW of six-hour storage at full capacity credit, the 8-, 10-, and 12-hour bins are already filled by PSH. So, if the model wants to build additional storage capacity, it will shuffle around the allocated storage capacity to the optimal âbinsâ as it fills the 24-hour bin. In this example, if any 8-hour storage is built it will be allocated to the 8-hour bin, and some PSH capacity will be pushed out of that bin and re-allocated to the 24-hour bin at Â½ capacity credit (12 hours / 24 hours). So, even though the duration required for storage to receive full capacity credit at this point is 24 hours, 8-hour storage would receive a marginal capacity credit of Â½ because there is an excess of 12-hour storage already installed in the system.</p>

<p>Storage capacity credit is sensitive to a variety of factors on the power system, so rather than ignoring the many factors that can influence storage capacity credit we simply pass the model information on what storage <em>could</em> do to serve peaking capacity based on load shape and storage duration and then allow the model to choose the least-cost option based on the suite of available resources and the entire set of storage revenue streams that are represented within the ReEDS model.</p>

<p>Several shortcomings arise under the capacity credit-based approach for evaluating resource adequacy. In ReEDS, planning resource can be traded between the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order 1000 regions, however the capacity credit is still assessed where the resource is sited, misrepresenting the evaluation for some generation assets when that assest is used to meet peak demand in a different region. Additionally, identifying stress periods using peak net load hours can potentially miss system stress that results from events spanning consecutive days, such as extreme weather, or from events that occur outside of peak net load periods. The alternative stress period formulation in ReEDS attempts to mitigate some of these deficiencies. In this approach, a probabilistic resource adequacy suite (PRAS) developed by NREL is brought into the loop, allowing ReEDS to pass the system design to the resource adequacy model after every solve year. The PRAS model is described in a separate publication [42] , but its use in conjunction with the ReEDS model is included briefly here. Essentially PRAS ingests the ReEDS build out and utilizes 7 years of load and weather data to identify the periods with the highest risk of unserved energy, these periods are then passed back to ReEDS to ensure sufficient capacity is built. Within PRAS the expected unserved energy is evaluated by running a sequential Monte Carlo model to simulate the probability of individual assets failing over the full multi-year optimization horizon producing results for unserved energy. The simulation is run for multiple forced outage draws after which the collective system stress periods can be identified.</p>

<h4>Planning Reserve Margins<a class="headerlink" href="#planning-reserve-margins" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>The planning reserve margin fractions applied in ReEDS are based on reserve margin requirements for NERC reliability subregions <span id="id178">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1714" title="NERC. 2023 Long-term reliability assessment.

Each ReEDS BA must meet the reserve margin requirement. Under the capacity credit method regions can trade firm capacity subject to transmission limits on AC or DC corridors. The planning reserve margin is during the cold and hot seasons when using the capacity credit method and during all stress periods when using the stress period method.</p>

<h3>Operational Reliability<a class="headerlink" href="#operational-reliability" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>In addition to ensuring adequate capacity to satisfy long-term planning reserve requirements, ReEDS requires operational reliabilityâthat is, the ability to continue operating the bulk-power system in the event of a sudden disturbance <span id="id179">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1687" title="NERC. Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards. Technical Report, North American Electric Reliability Corporation, 2016.">NERC, 2016</a>]</span>.

<p>All ancillary reserve requirements must be satisfied in each BA for each time-slice; however, reserve provisionÂ can be traded between BAs using AC transmission corridors. Trades are only allowed within an RTO and not across RTO boundaries. The amount of reserves that can be traded is limited by the amount of carrying capacity of an AC transmission corridor that is not already being used for trading energy.</p>
<p>The ability of technologies to contribute to reserves is limited by the ramping requirement for a given reserve product, the plant ramp rate, and online capacity (<a class="reference internal" href="#generation-techs-flexability-params"><span class="std std-numref">Table 22</span></a>). Online capacity is approximated in ReEDS as the maximum generation from all time-slices within a modeled day. Reserves can be provided by generation and storage technologies that are turned on but not fully dispatched in a time-slice. In addition, demand-side interruptible load can also contribute to reserve requirements, if enabled in a scenario. Nuclear, PV, and wind are not allowed to contribute toward the supply of reserves.</p>
<p>The cost for providing regulation reserves is represented in ReEDS using data from <span id="id185">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1234" title="Marissa Hummon, Paul Denholm, Jennie Jorgenson, David Palchak, Brendan Kirby, and Ookie Ma.

Because ReEDS does not clearly distinguish between coal fuel types, $12.5/MWh is the assumed regulation cost for all coal technologies. The cost of providing regulation reserves from Gas-CT, geothermal, biopower, land-fill gas, and CAES is assumed to be the same as oil/gas steam.</p>

<p>ReEDS represents EPAâs GHG emissions standards for power plants. For existing coal plants, ReEDS models an emissions rate-based compliance mechanism, enforced at the state level. In 2032 and for every year thereafter, the emissions rate (metric tons CO<sub>2</sub> per MWh) of a statesâ coal fleet must be less than or equal to the emissions rate of a coal-CCS plant with a 90% capture rate. This enables some unabated coal plants to remain online after 2032 if that state also has coal-CCS plants with high capture rates that stay online and generate, decreasing the average emissions rate. Also starting in 2032, new gas plants must either retrofit with CCS or operate below a 40% capacity factor. Existing gas plants are not regulated per the regulations.</p>

<h4>Cross-State Air Pollution Rule<a class="headerlink" href="#cross-state-air-pollution-rule" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>ReEDS applies the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) using caps on power plant emissions to the states in the eastern half of the United States over which the rules are imposed. From 2017 onward, CSAPR annual emission allowance budgets for NO<sub>x</sub> are applied at the state level using the Phase 2 caps <span id="id190">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id900" title="EPA. eGRID2007 Version1.1 Year 2005 Summary Tables. Technical Report, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C., 2008.">EPA, 2008</a>]</span>. The caps are applied only during the ozone season. ReEDS applies a seasonal estimate of these ozone season caps that adjusts for the overlap of ReEDS season definitions and ozone season definitions. States can trade allowance credits within the eligible trading groups, but must keep emissions below the required assurance levels.</p>
<p>Sulphur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) emission limits are not represented in the model because the caps would not be binding in the model except in historical years.</p>

<h4>California Carbon Cap<a class="headerlink" href="#california-carbon-cap" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>Californiaâs Global Warming Solution Act of 2016 (referred to as Assembly Bill 398 or AB 398) established a program to reduce economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. In 2016, legislation was passed that codified the 2030 greenhouse gas target to 40% below 1990 levels. In ReEDS, these state carbon caps are modeled as a cap on electricity-system CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from generators either located in California or serving load in the state. Direct CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from generators located in California count toward the cap. For imported electricity, the model calculates the regional emissions rate [metric tons CO<sub>2</sub>/MWh] after each solve year, and then apply that rate to imports in the next solve year. In scenarios that also have a national carbon cap that reaches zero emissions, the emission intensity of California imports is also set to zero for years when the national carbon cap is zero.</p>
<p>Because Californiaâs greenhouse gas reduction targets are legislated for all economic sectors while ReEDS only models the electricity sector, we rely on published economy-wide modeling results to estimate electric sector-specific caps that are used in ReEDS. In particular, we apply power sector caps based on the annual CA electric sector emissions (from in-state and imported electricity) from California Public Utilities Commission <span id="id191">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id639" title="CPUC. Decision Setting Requirements for Load Serving Entities Filing Integrated Resource Plans. February 2018.">CPUC, 2018</a>]</span>, which provides guidance for a 42 million tCO<sub>2</sub> cap by 2030. We enforce that cap from 2030 to 2050. The pre-2030 cap ramps linearly from 60 million tCO<sub>2</sub> in 2020 to the 42 million tCO<sub>2</sub> in 2030. Note that we also model Californiaâs RPS policy.</p>

<h3>Federal and State Tax Incentives<a class="headerlink" href="#federal-and-state-tax-incentives" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<section id="federal-tax-credits-for-clean-electricity-and-captured-carbon">
<h4>Federal Tax Credits for Clean Electricity and Captured Carbon<a class="headerlink" href="#federal-tax-credits-for-clean-electricity-and-captured-carbon" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>Existing federal tax incentives are included in ReEDS, aligned with the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). These include the PTC and the ITC for clean electricity, the 45Q credit for capturing and storing carbon, the 45U credits for existing nuclear generation, the 45V credit for producing hydrogen and the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) depreciation schedules. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref52" id="id196" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>46<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> Current technology-specific depreciation schedules are modeled for all years, because we assume they are permanent parts of the tax code.</p>
<p>Four clean electricity production and investment tax credits are represented in ReEDS:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC):</strong> $26/MWh for 10 years (2022 dollars) plus a bonus credit that starts at $1.3/MWh and increases to $2.6/MWh by 2028</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (ITC):</strong> 30%, plus a domestic content bonus credit that starts at an additional 2.5% and increases to 5% by 2028 (for totals of 32.5% and 35% respectively). Energy community bonuses are also applied based on the location of the new build, with an additional 10% bonus for building within an energy community. For ReEDS regions that are ony partially covered by energy communities, the 10% bonus is derated by the portion of the region (by land area) that is made up of energy communities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Captured CO<sub>2</sub> Incentive (45Q):</strong> $85 per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> for 12 years for fossil-CCS and bioenergy-CCS, and $180 per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> for 12 years for direct air capture; nominal through 2026 and inflation adjusted after that</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Existing Nuclear Production Tax Credit (45U):</strong> This tax credit is $15/MWh (2022 dollars), but it is reduced if the market value of the electricity produced by the generator exceeds $25/MWh. As a simplification, this dynamic calculation was not directly represented in ReEDS. Instead, to represent the effect of this provision, existing nuclear generators are not subject to economic retirement in ReEDS through 2032.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (45V):</strong> Up to $3/kg of hydrogen produced, based on the lifecycle emissions of hydrogen production. To ensure the low carbon intensity of the electricity powering hydrogen producers and receive the 45V credit, hydrogen producers must purchase and retire Energy Attribute Credits for all electricity they consume.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that IRA allows for bonus credits for both the clean electricity PTC and ITC (but not applicable to 45U or 45Q) if a project either meet certain domestic manufacturing requirements or is in an âenergy community.â Projects can obtain both bonus credits if they meet both requirements, which would equate to $5.2/MWh for the PTC and 20% for the ITC. In ReEDS, this is simplified per the summary above. In practice, there will likely be greater diversity of captured credits amongst projects. Relatedly, the values above are based on the assumption that all projects will meet the prevailing wage requirements.</p>
<p>Under IRA, eligible clean electricity projects can select whether to take the PTC or the ITC. As implemented in ReEDS, however, an a priori analysis was performed to estimate which credit was most likely to be more valuable, and the technology was assigned that credit. The assignments are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>PTC:</strong> Onshore wind, utility-scale PV, and biopower</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ITC:</strong> Offshore wind, CSP, geothermal, hydropower, new nuclear, PSH, distributed PV, and batteries.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>PV-battery gets both the PTC and ITC in ReEDS. PTC is applied to only the PV portions of PVB generation, and ITC is applied to the battery component.</p>
<p>As represented in ReEDS, the value of the tax credits is reduced by 10% for non-CCS technologies and 7.5% for CCS technologies, as a simple approximation of the costs of monetizing the tax credits (such as tax equity financing).<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref53" id="id197" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>47<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> These cost penalties are not reflected in the values given for each incentive above.</p>
<p>The clean electricity PTC and ITC are scheduled to start phasing out when electricity sector greenhouse gas emissions fall below 25% of 2022 levels, or 2032, whichever is later. Once the tax credits phase out, they remain at zeroâthere is no reactivation of the credits if the emissions threshold is exceeded at a later point. The exact value of the threshold that would trigger the IRA clean electricity tax credits phasing out has not been announced but is estimated at 386 million metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e in this modeling. The 45Q and 45U credits do not have a dynamic phaseout and are instead just scheduled to end at the end of 2032.</p>
<p>In the dGen model, distributed PV is assumed to take an ITC: the 25D credit for residential, and the Section 48 credit for commercial and industrial. For residential projects placed in service through 2032 the ITC is assumed to be 30%, declining to zero for projects placed in service in 2036. For commercial and industrial projects coming online through 2035 the ITC is assumed to be 40%, dropping to zero after that. These representations are simplifications, as there can be greater diversity in captured value depending on factors such as ownership type and tax status. Furthermore, due to limitations of the models used in this study, the dynamic phase out of the Section 48 ITC is not reflected. In practice, most scenarios did not cross the emissions threshold specified in IRA at this point, and therefore the adoption of commercial and industrial distributed PV in the later years of those scenarios is potentially underestimated. A tax credit extension scenario provides a view of distributed PV deployment without a phase out.</p>
<p>IRA includes additional bonus credits (up to 20%) for up to 1.8 GW per year for solar facilities that are placed in service in low-income communities. The dGen model runs used in ReEDS does not have an explicit representation of that additional bonus credit. Instead, 0.9 GW per year of distributed PV was added to the original dGen estimates through 2032. The estimate of 0.9 GW reflects the assumption that some of the projects capturing the bonus credit may not be additional (i.e., they would have occurred anyway even if the bonus credit was not available). The 0.9 GW per year is added in such a way that the spatial distribution of distributed PV remains unchanged.</p>
<p>All the IRA tax credits are assumed to have safe harbor periods, meaning a technology can capture a credit as long as it started construction before the expiration of the tax credit. The maximum safe harbor periods are assumed to be 10 years for offshore wind, 6 years for CCS and nuclear, and 4 years for all other technologies. Generators will obtain the largest credit available within their safe harbor window, meaning that once a credit starts to phase down or terminate, ReEDS assumes that efforts were made to start construction at the maximum length of the safe harbor window before the unit came online. In practice this means ReEDS will show generators coming online and capturing the tax credits for several years beyond the nominal year in which they expired.</p>

<section id="state-renewable-portfolio-standards">
<h3>State Renewable Portfolio Standards<a class="headerlink" href="#state-renewable-portfolio-standards" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>ReEDS models state RPSs, including technology set-asides and renewable energy certificates (RECs) that can count toward RPS compliance. RPS rules are complex and can vary significantly between states. The RPS representation in ReEDS attempts to model the primary impacts of these RPS rules but includes many simplifying assumptions. In addition, in recent years there have been numerous changes to RPS legislation. We periodically update our representation to capture the recent changes to the legislation; however, the numerous and frequent changes to state laws create challenges to having a precise representation of all RPS legislation.</p>
<p>RPS targets and technology set-asides for 2010-2050 can be found in /inputs/state_policies/rps_fraction.csv. These valuesâalong with many other data that we use to represent nuanced RPS rulesâare based on data compiled by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which takes into account the in-state REC multiplier incentives and load adjustments (e.g., sales-weighted RPS targets considering different load-serving entities subject to compliance, such as investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities, and cooperatives).<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref54" id="id198" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>48<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> Solar includes UPV and roÂ­oftop PV, wind includes both land-based and offshore technologies, and distributed generation (DG) includes rooftop PV and ground-mounted PV systems located within the distribution network.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref55" id="id199" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>49<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> ReEDS also models alternative compliance payments for unmet RPS requirement for both main RPS targets and solar/wind set-asides as is consistent with the available data.<sup>69</sup></p>
<p>Technology eligibility for state RPS requirements is modeled for each state.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref55" id="id200" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>49<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> For instance, Californiaâs RPS does not allow in-state rooftop solar technologies to contribute toward its RPS. Additionally, every state has specific rules regarding hydropower generationâs eligibility toward contributing RECs, which are usually based on each unitâs vintage and size (e.g., small hydropower with specific capacity cut-offs are eligible in some states). ReEDS models these as allowable generation fractions from Barbose <span id="id201"><a class="reference internal" href="#id340" title="Galen Barbose. U.S. State Renewables Portfolio &amp; Clean Electricity Standards: 2024 Status Update. Technical Report, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, 2024.">2024</a></span>, which is imposed on each stateâs total hydropower generation thereby limiting the amount of hydropower RECs that each state could produce.</p>
<p>Except for California, ReEDS enforces an upper limit on the total RECs (both bundled and unbundled) that can be imported for that stateâs RPS compliance. For California alone, due to its unique out-of-state rules, ReEDS enforces two upper limits, one on the total unbundled REC imports and the other on the total bundled REC imports. There is a myriad of possibilities of interstate REC transactions, in terms of both which two states can transact and the quantity of those transactions. To constrain the solution space of ReEDS to credible values, the interstate REC trading modeling is based on historical observations <span id="id202">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1210" title="Ed Holt. Potential RPS Markets for Renewable Energy Generators. Technical Report, Ed Holt &amp; Associates, Inc., July 2016.">Holt, 2016</a>]</span> and captured by inputs/state_policies/rectable.csv. The out-of-state total REC import percentages for each state in are limited to those observed in 2012â2013 <span id="id203">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1165" title="Jenny Heeter. Cross-state RPS Visualization. http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/docs/index.html, 2015.">Heeter, 2015</a>]</span> with additional updates made over the years based on state input and observed trading behavior.</p>
<p>In order to prevent laundering of credits through two states that are not allowed to trade but have a common trading partner, ReEDS includes a requirement that a state may not export more credits than it can produce. If a state is using alternative compliance payments to meet its PRS or CES requirement, that state is further limited in its ability to export credits.</p>
<p>Several states have implemented policies directed at offshore wind. To represent these actions in ReEDS, we prescribe a floor to offshore wind capacity based on known projects and policy mandates. Specifically, we include offshore wind capacity that meets at least one of three criteria: (1) currently operating capacity; (2) projects in active solicitation processes; and (3) to meet statutory policy requirements. The projects are based on tracking conducted for the NREL Offshore Wind Technologies Market Report, and state totals are shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#offshore-wind-capacity"><span class="std std-numref">Table 25</span></a>.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#refoffshorenote" id="id204" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>50<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> The model allows for economic deployment of offshore wind capacity beyond these levels. All policy-mandated offshore wind capacity is assumed to be rebuilt if retiring the capacity would bring the total below the mandated limit.</p>
<p>Finally, voluntary renewable energy credits are also represented in ReEDS. Only renewable energy technologies are allowed to supply voluntary RECs, and Canadian imports are not allowed. The voluntary REC requirement is based on the observed amount of voluntary RECs from Heeter et al. <span id="id205"><a class="reference internal" href="#id1166" title="Jenny Heeter, Eric O'Shaughnessy, and Rebecca Burd. Status and Trends in the Voluntary Market (2020 Data). Technical Report, National Renewable Energy Lab, 2021.">2021</a></span> and the requirement is assumed to grow by the smallest amount that has been observed year-over-year (0.1624% in absolute terms). The voluntary requirement includes an alternative compliance payment of $10/MWh (in 2004$).</p>

<h3>Clean Energy Standards<a class="headerlink" href="#clean-energy-standards" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>As of November 2024, 16 states had clean energy standards (CESs) (see <a class="reference internal" href="#clean-energy-req"><span class="std std-numref">Table 26</span></a>). CES values are effective values<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref56" id="id206" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>51<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> and are taken from Barbose <span id="id207"><a class="reference internal" href="#id340" title="Galen Barbose. U.S. State Renewables Portfolio &amp; Clean Electricity Standards: 2024 Status Update. Technical Report, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, 2024.">2024</a></span>. These CESs are in effect generalized versions of RPSs; their model representations are very similar with technology eligibility being the primary difference. The annual compliance for states with a CES policy can be found in inputs/state_policies/ces_fraction.csv.</p>
<p>For all but one of the CES policies (Massachusetts), we assume all zero-carbon-emitting sources (on a direct emissions basis) can contribute to the CES requirement. This includes all renewable energy technologies (including hydropower and distributed PV), nuclear power, and imports from Canada.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref57" id="id208" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>52<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> The modeled CES policies set a floor on electricity generated from clean energy technologies but does not cap generation from nonclean sources. As a result, in the model representation, a state can continue to generate from existing fossil plants if the amount of clean energy generation exceeds the requirement (even if the requirement approaches 100% of sales). Most of the CES policies are assumed to start in 2030 and ramp to their final targets by 2040 or 2050.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref58" id="id209" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>53<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> For other aspects of the CES model representation, we use the same assumptions as the corresponding state RPS. These include assumptions about credit trading and variations in load-serving entity requirements.

<h3>Nuclear Power Plant Policies<a class="headerlink" href="#nuclear-power-plant-policies" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>There are four states that have enacted that provide compensation or other assistance for in-state nuclear power plants: Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York. For these states, the nuclear power plants are not allowed to retire until after the policy expires, unless the power plant already has an announced retirement date. The policy end-dates are taken from EIA <span id="id211"><a class="reference internal" href="#id839" title="EIA. Electric Power Monthly.

<h3>Other Policy Capabilities<a class="headerlink" href="#other-policy-capabilities" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the existing policies described above, ReEDS also includes several optional policy implementations that are useful for exploring alternative futures or the impact of existing policies. These additional policy frameworks include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>National Clean Energy Standard:</strong> This framework allows the user to specify which technologies count as âclean energyâ and enforce a minimum limit for the penetration of these clean energy technologies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>National Renewable Portfolio Standard:</strong> This standard enforces a national RPS, with the RPS trajectory defined by the user.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Carbon Cap-and-Trade:</strong> This feature allows the user to specify national-or subnational carbon cap-and-trade policies, including options to represent trading limitations and banking and borrowing of allowances.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Carbon Tax:</strong> This feature implements a user-specified carbon tax on burner-tip emissions from the power sector.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>National Emissions Limit:</strong> This framework limits the total national emissions according to user-specified values. The limit is often referred to as a carbon cap or CO<sub>2</sub> cap. Users can specify these CO<sub>2</sub> cap trajectories and/or add their own in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inputs/emission_constraints/co2_cap.csv</span></code>. National emissions limit is turned off by default but can be turned on in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cases.csv</span></code> by using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_AnnualCap</span></code>. The cap is applied on a net basis, so negative emission technologies can offset power plant emissions. Users can restrict negative emissions technologies to only offset emissions from fossil CCS plants by setting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_NoFossilOffsetCDR</span></code> in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cases.csv</span></code> to 1 (itâs default value is 0).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sub-National Emissions Limit:</strong> For sub-national ReEDS runs with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions limit turned on and CO<sub>2</sub> cap specified, the sub-national emissions limit is automatically scaled down from the national emissions limit above to the sub-national region that the user defines, based on eGRIDâs 2022 county-level CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Alternative ITC and PTC Schedules:</strong> In addition to the ITC and PTC schedules described in <a class="reference internal" href="#federal-and-state-emission-standards"><span class="xref myst">Federal and State Tax Incentives</span></a>, the ITC and PTC can be modified to apply for any number of years and to any technology.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Alternative Financing Measures:</strong> Policy-related financing impacts such as MACRS or the under-construction provisions for the ITC and PTC can be modified as specified by the user.</p></li>

Technical Report, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, 2024.">NREL, 2024</a>]</span>, using the âMarket Factor Financialsâ and the 30-year capital recovery period options. The ATB has technology-specific and time-varying financing parameters, including interest rate, rate of return on equity, debt fraction, and tax rate. Other elements of the ATB included in ReEDS include construction schedules, MACRS depreciation schedules, and inflation rates.

<p>Cost calculations within the model are done assuming a 30-year economic lifetime for all generation assets (transmission lines and AC/DC converters have a 40-year economic lifetime).

<h3>Electric Sector Costs<a class="headerlink" href="#electric-sector-costs" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>Two system-wide cost metrics are calculated from each ReEDS run: a present value of direct electric sector system costs and electricity price. These cost calculations are not part of the ReEDS optimization process; they are calculated after the ReEDS optimizations have been conducted. ReEDS also includes a postprocessing option for estimating retail rates and for estimating the health costs of air pollution, described further below.</p>
<section id="present-value-of-direct-electric-sector-cost">
<h4>Present Value of Direct Electric Sector Cost<a class="headerlink" href="#present-value-of-direct-electric-sector-cost" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>The present value system cost metric accounts for capital and operating expenditures incurred over the entire study horizon for all technology types considered, including generation, transmission, and storage. The cost in each future year is discounted by a user-defined discount rate, and by default it is set to 5%. Not to be confused with the discount rate used in the optimization for investment decisions, the <em>investment</em> discount rate is selected to represent private-sector investment decisions for electric system infrastructure, and it approximates the expected market rate of return of investors. All costs incurred before the start of the specified economic horizon are assumed to be sunk and are therefore not included in the system cost metric. Details about how the system costs are calculated in ReEDS can be found in the <a class="reference internal" href="#calculating-present-value-of-direct-electric-sector-cost"><span class="xref myst">Calculating Present Value of Direct Electric Sector Cost section</span></a> of the appendix.</p>

This calculation takes advantage of the linear programming formulation of the model. Specifically, the marginal price on a model constraint represents how much the objective function would change given a change in the right side of the constraint. Each constraint can be viewed as a market with a marginal price and quantity. At optimality, the total revenue (i.e., the product of price and quantity) across all constraints equals the objective function value. The constraints within ReEDS are written such that the marginal values from the load constraints can be used as a proxy for the competitive electricity price. The load constraints are linked to the supply-demand balance constraints, capacity constraints, operating reserve constraints, and others through load variables. Taking the marginal value from the load balance constraint, we can find the marginal value of an additional unit of load (e.g., MWh) to the system, accounting for other requirements. Specifically, the reported competitive prices in ReEDS capture five categories of requirements, including energy, capacity, operating reserves, and state-level and national-level RPS requirements (see <a class="reference internal" href="#grid-service-constraints"><span class="std std-numref">Table 28</span></a>). The competitive prices can be reported at different regional aggregation level, scaled by requirement quantities. Details about how these prices are calculated in ReEDS can be found in the Marginal Electricity Prices section of the appendix.</p>

<p>Besides âcompetitive electricity pricesâ, ReEDS also calculates the average cost of electricity at the national, BA-level or state-level by taking the annualized total costs of building and operating the system in a specific geographic area and divided that by the electricity load in that area. Annualized costs for existing (i.e., pre-2010) power plants are also considered given plantsâ initial investment costs and the built year. BA-level average electricity prices also consider the impact of energy and capacity trading. These prices reflect the average costs to serve the load in certain areas. Detailed calculation equations can be found in the Average Electricity Prices section of the appendix.</p>

<section id="retail-rates">
<h4>Retail Rates<a class="headerlink" href="#retail-rates" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>ReEDS estimates average retail electricity rates using the method described by Brown et al.<span id="id215">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id463" title="Patrick R. Brown, Pieter J. Gagnon, J. Sean Corcoran, and Wesley J. Cole. Retail Rate Projections for Long-Term Electricity System Models.

This retail rate method is a separate module run after a ReEDS run has been completed. It uses a detailed bottom-up accounting method for projecting retail rates based on the ReEDS buildout and operation. It uses an accounting framework most aligned with an investor-owned utility, and accounts for depreciation, taxes, and the breakdown between operating and capitalized (rate-based)
expenses. Distribution, administration, and intra-regional transmission costs are projected forward based
on empirical trends from 2010-2019. For more details on the method, see Brown et al.<span id="id216">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id463" title="Patrick R. Brown, Pieter J. Gagnon, J. Sean Corcoran, and Wesley J. Cole. Retail Rate Projections for Long-Term Electricity System Models.

<p>Since the publication of Brown et al. (2022), the retail rate method has been expanded to handle negative emission technology cost allocation. Because the retail rate method reports state-level average retail rates, if one state builds a negative emission technology such as DAC or BECCS, that state will incur the costs even though the emissions offset by that unit are likely to be from another state. The retail rate method allocates the cost of the negative emission technology to the states with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, weighted by the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

<h4>Cost of Health Damages from Air Pollution<a class="headerlink" href="#cost-of-health-damages-from-air-pollution" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>In addition to direct system costs, ReEDS also includes a postprocessing step for estimating health damages associated with air pollution. Currently this focuses on mortality from long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref61" id="id217" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>56<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> from fossil fuel combustion in the electric sector.</p>
<p>To estimate health damages, ReEDS relies on estimates of the mortality risk per tonne of emissions from three reduced complexity air quality models (AP2, EASIUR, and InMAP).<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref62" id="id218" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>57<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> Each of these models estimates PM<sub>2.5</sub> formation associated with emissions of precursor pollutants (NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>). To generate annualized premature mortality, each model applies a concentration response function from one of two studies linking exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> to increased mortality risk. These two studies, referred to as the American Cancer Society Study (ACS) and Harvard Six-Cities Study (H6C) provide estimates of the relationship between pollution exposure and premature mortality <span id="id219">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1064" title="Elisabeth A.

The result is an estimate of the mortality risk per tonne of pollutant emitted in each U.S. county. This marginal damage estimate can be aggregated to the ReEDS balancing area level and multiplied by total emissions to estimate total mortality.</p>
<p>As a final step, annual premature deaths from air pollution can be translated into a monetary value by applying a value of a statistical life. For this ReEDS relies on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyâs estimate of $7.4 million in 2006 dollars <span id="id220">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id909" title="EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). Mortality Risk Valuation. https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/mortality-risk-valuation, April 2014.">EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency), 2014</a>]</span> inflated to a present-day dollar value ($9.9 million in 2021 dollars). These costs can then be translated into costs per unit of generation and cumulative (discounted) cost over the study period.</p>
<p>The approach described here focuses on direct emissions from the electric power sector, and thus does not capture estimates from other sectors (such as transportation, buildings, and industry) or upstream emissions (such as from fossil fuel extraction or power plant manufacturing). It also does not quantify any social costs of climate change from CO<sub>2</sub> or other greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<h3>Modeled Economic Metrics<a class="headerlink" href="#modeled-economic-metrics" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>ReEDS calculates multiple economic metrics for analyzing investment decisions in the model, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Levelized cost of energy (LCOE)</p></li>
<li><p>Technology value</p></li>
<li><p>Net value of energy (NVOE)</p></li>
<li><p>Net value of capacity (NVOC)</p></li>
<li><p>System profitability</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These metrics are described in detail below.</p>
<section id="levelized-cost-of-energy">
<h4>Levelized Cost of Energy<a class="headerlink" href="#levelized-cost-of-energy" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>LCOE measures the unit cost of electricity of a specific technology, which is normally calculated as lifetime costs divided by energy production. Specifically, the LCOE is calculated as follows <span id="id221">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1722" title="NREL. 2019 Annual Technology Baseline. Technical Report, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, 2019.">NREL, 2019</a>]</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[LCOE = \frac{FCR \times CAPEX + FOM}{CF \times 8,760} + VOM + FUEL\]</div>
<p>where FCR is the fixed charge rate; CAPEX is the capital expenditures; FOM is the fixed operations and maintenance costs; CF is the capacity factor; 8,760 is the number of hours in a year; VOM is variable operations and maintenance costs; and FUEL is fuel costs (if applicable).</p>
<p>In each model year, ReEDS reports the LCOE for all technology options considering different variations in tax credit treatments and capacity factor assumptions. ReEDS also calculates the LCOE for technologies that are built in this model year using the generation from these technologies.</p>
</section>
<section id="technology-value">
<h4>Technology Value<a class="headerlink" href="#technology-value" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>ReEDS reports the value that generators receive from providing grid services. Value is calculated as the product of service prices and service provision quantities. For example, the value of a generator that comes from providing energy service to meet planning reserve margin requirement is calculated as the price of capacity multiplied by the amount of firm capacity the generator can provide. The reported revenues capture energy, capacity, operating reserve, and state-level and national RPS requirements. Revenues can be normalized either by the amount of generation or by the amount of installed capacity.</p>
<p>Revenues are closely related to, but are different from the electricity price and service requirement quantity parameters. Revenues consider the <em>provision</em> of different services from a certain generator in a region, whereas service requirement quantities calculate the <em>demand</em> of different services in a region. The sum of revenues from all generating technologies in a specific region does not necessarily equal the sum of products of all service prices and corresponding service requirements.</p>
</section>
<section id="net-value">
<h4>Net Value<a class="headerlink" href="#net-value" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>ReEDS reports different economic viability metrics that consider both <em>costs</em> and <em>values</em> of generating technologies to fully evaluate the economic competitiveness of a certain technology, and to provide intuitive explanations about investment decisions in the model. âValuesâ of a generator reflect the potential economic benefit from displacing or avoiding the cost of providing the services from other (marginal) assets, while âcostsâ aggregate all different sources of costs needed to build and operate a power plant to provide services. We define ânet valueâ as the difference between values and costs. Net value is related to a concept in linear programming called âreduced cost.â Mills and Wiser <span id="id222"><a class="reference internal" href="#id1607" title="Andrew Mills and Ryan Wiser. An Evaluation of Solar Valuation Methods Used in Utility Planning and Procurement Processes. Technical Report, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, 2012.">2012</a></span> describe reduced cost in the context of electricity system modeling.</p>
<p>We report three types of such metrics to assess the economic viability of generators: net value of energy, net value of capacity, and system profitability metrics (<a class="reference internal" href="#net-value-metrics"><span class="std std-numref">Table 29</span></a>). These metrics are reported both for new investments in certain model year and for existing generators that have been built.</p>
<table class="docutils align-default" id="net-value-metrics">
<caption><span class="caption-number">Table 29 </span><span class="caption-text">Summary of Net Value Metrics</span><a class="headerlink" href="#net-value-metrics" title="Link to this table">ï</a></caption>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>System profitability</p></td>
<td><p>f(Value/Cost) [unitless]</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Net value of energy (NVOE) measures the unit profit of a specific technology, calculated as the difference between generator revenue and costs, then normalized by the energy production. The typical unit is dollars per megawatt-hour ($/MWh). Similarly, net value of capacity (NVOC) measures the unit profit of a specific technology, calculated as the difference between generator revenue and costs, then normalized by the installed capacity. The typical unit is dollars per megawatt ($/MW).</p>
<p>Both of these two metrics are normalized metrics; because the denominators vary broadly for different generator types, they may not reflect the competitiveness of technologies consistently. Therefore, we report a third type of economic viability metric, namely system profitability metrics, which are essentially unitless functions of the ratio between values and costs. Examples include profitability index (value/cost) and return on investment (value/cost minus one). We report both metrics in ReEDS, acknowledging that there are other formats of system profitability metrics.</p>
<p>These economic viability metrics help explain investment decisions in the model. Specifically, for all types of new investment in a certain model year, the model considers all the costs to build and operate a certain technology as <em>costs</em>, and the contribution of the technology to all binding constraints as <em>values</em> (i.e., service provision). Typical value sources are discussed above in <a class="reference internal" href="#technology-value"><span class="xref myst">Technology Value</span></a>. In calculations of economic viability metrics, however, other types of âvaluesâ areÂ included to fully reflect model decisions. For example, an increase of ancillary service requirements that are due to higher wind penetration is counted as a negative value stream for wind, and it is included in the metrics calculation here. Therefore, these metrics fully reflect all the model constraints related to the investment decision.</p>

<p>The ReEDS reduced-form dispatch and variable renewable parameterization aims to

<p>The ReEDS-PCM linkage involves several transformations to the ReEDS solution to
prepare it for use in the PCM. These transformations include disaggregating the
ReEDS solution and adding the necessary parameters for PCM. To maintain
consistency, the linkage preserves the spatial resolution of ReEDS (BA or
county) and operates the PCM as a zonal model that matches ReEDS BAs (or county)
with a simplified transmission interface between them. The PCM translation uses
ReEDS transmission line capacity, while reactance and resistance are derived
from ReEDS transmission properties to represent the aggregated transmission
system.
For generating capacity, ReEDS aggregate capacity is converted to individual
units in the PCM using characteristic unit sizes for each technology. Where
possible and reasonable, ReEDS cost and performance parameters are used, though
these values can be improved if more data is available. If a parameter is
missing or inconsistently used in ReEDS due to structural differences between
the models, the default translation uses average values across the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NREL/R2X/blob/main/src/r2x/defaults/pcm_defaults.json">WECC</a>
for the equivalent technologies in ReEDS.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref63" id="id226" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>59<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>Once the ReEDS solution is converted to a PCM, one can simulate
hourly dispatch over a full year and compare results with ReEDS outcomes. A
consistent solution builds confidence in the effectiveness of ReEDS capacity
expansion decisions, while inconsistencies and reliability concerns such as load
shedding indicate the need for improving capacity expansion model structures.

<p>The ReEDS supply curve for renewable technologies, including onshore wind, CSP,
utility scale PV, and geothermal are produced by reV. The ReEDS-reV linkage
allows for regional ReEDS investment decisions to be mapped backed to individual
reV supply curve sites. Site-specific supply curve data from reV is binned for
the ReEDS supply curve by default into 5-40 bins depending on the specific
resource type (see numbins_[technology] in cases.csv). By tracking the timing
and investment decisions within each of these bins, the ReEDS-rev linkage maps
regional capacity back to the individual sites from which the bins were derived.
The resulting siting data is used to further the understanding of the ReEDS
capacity expansion decisions and identify areas for improvement for resource
siting in reV. The ReEDS-reV linkage is a key component in the translation of
ReEDS capacity expansion results to a nodal production cost modeling databases.</p>

<h3>Natural Gas Supply Curves<a class="headerlink" href="#natural-gas-supply-curves" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>The ReEDS model does not explicitly model the U.S. natural gas (NG) system, which involves multiple sectors of the economy and includes complex infrastructure and markets. Rather, a regional supply curve representation is a used to approximate the NG system as it interacts with the electric sector. For more information on the impact of natural gas representation in ReEDS, see Cole et al. <span id="id2314"><a class="reference internal" href="#id620" title="Wesley J. Cole, Kenneth B. Medlock III, and Aditya Jani. A view to the future of natural gas and electricity: An integrated modeling approach. Energy Economics, 2016. doi:10.1016/j.eneco.2016.03.005.">2016</a></span>.</p>
<p>The premise of using regional supply curves is that the price in each region will be a function of both the regional and national NG demand. The supply curves are parameterized from AEO scenarios for each of the nine EIA census divisions (see <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-offshore-wind-resource"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 20</span></a>). Two methods exist to parameterize the natural gas supply curves and both are discussed here. The first method which involves estimating a linear regression of prices on regional and national quantities has been used in previous version in ReEDS and is discussed first. The second method is relatively new to ReEDS and involves parameterizing a constant elasticity of supply curve and is discussed second. Through multiple tests, we have found minimal differences in results between the two versions (1% or less of a change in national generation by technology).</p>
<p><strong>Linear Regression Approach</strong></p>
<p>The AEO scenarios were used to estimate parameters for the following NG price-consumption model:</p>
<figure class="align-default" id="ng-price-consumption-model">
<img alt="_images/ng-price-consumption-model.png" src="_images/ng-price-consumption-model.png" />

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>where <em>P<sub>i,j</sub></em> is the price of natural gas (in $/MMBtu) in region <em>i</em> and year <em>j</em>, the <em>Î±</em> parameters are the intercept terms of the supply curves with adjustments made based on region (<em>Î±<sub>i</sub></em>), year (<em>Î±<sub>j</sub></em>), and the region-year interaction (<em>Î±<sub>i,j</sub></em>), <em>Î²<sub>nat</sub></em> is the coefficient for the national NG demand (<em>Q<sub>nat</sub></em>, in quads), <em>Î²<sub>i</sub></em> is the coefficient for the regional NG demand (<em>Q<sub>i,j</sub></em>) in region <em>i</em>. Note that the four <em>Î±</em> parameters in [1] can in practice be represented using only <em>Î±<sub>i,j</sub></em>.</p>
<p>The Î² terms are regressed from AEO2014 scenarios, with nine of the 31 AEO2014 scenarios removed as outliers <span id="id2315">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id811" title="EIA. Annual Energy Outlook 2014. Technical Report DOE/EIA-0383(2014), U.S. DOE Energy Information Administration, Washington, D.C., 2014.">EIA, 2014</a>]</span>. These outlier scenarios typically include cases of very low or very high natural gas resource availability, which are useful for estimating NG price as a function of supply but not for estimating NG price as a function of demandâfor given supply scenarios. The national and regional Î² terms are reported in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-census-division-values"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 53</span></a>. We made a specific post-hoc adjustment to the regression modelâs outputs for one region; the Î²i term for the West North Central division was originally an order of magnitude higher than the other Î²i values because the West North Central usage in the electricity sector is so low (0.05 quad<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref65" id="id2316" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>61<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> in 2013, compared to ~0.5Â quad or more in most regions). The overall natural gas usage (i.e., not just electricity sector usage) in West North Central is similar to the usage in East North Central, so intuitively it makes sense to have a Î²i for West North Central relatively close to that of East North Central. We therefore manually adjusted the West North Central Î²i term to be 0.6 (in 2004$/MMBtu/quad) and recalculated the alpha terms with the new beta toÂ achieve the AEO2014 target prices. The situation in West North Central whereby such a small fraction of NG demand goes to electricity is unique; we do not believe that the other regions warrant similarÂ treatment.</p>

</figure>
<p>The âNationalâ value at the far left is <em>Î²<sub>nat</sub></em>. A <em>Î²</em> of 0.2 means that if demand increases by one quad, the price will increase by $0.20/MMBtu (see Equation [1]).</p>
<p>The <em>Î±</em> terms are then regressed for each individual scenario assuming the same <em>Î²</em> values for all scenarios. Although the <em>Î²</em> terms are derived from AEO2014 data, <em>Î±</em> terms are regressed using AEO2018 data for the scenario they are intended to represent <span id="id2317">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id817" title="EIA. Annual Energy Outlook 2019. Technical Report, U.S. Energy Information Administration, Washington, D.C., 2019.">EIA, 2019</a>]</span>. Thus, we assume natural gas price elasticity has remained constant while price projections shift over time as represented by the <em>Î±</em> values.</p>
<p><strong>Comparison of Elasticities from Regression Approach to Literature Values</strong></p>
<p>Technical literature tends to report the price elasticity of supply and the price elasticity of demand, which are estimates of the supply and demand, respectively, of a good given a change in price. In the formulation given by Equation [1], we attempt to estimate a value that is similar to the price elasticity of demandâwe estimate a change in price given a change in demand. Therefore, we present here a comparison against the price elasticity of demand as the closest available proxy, noting however that it is not necessarily identical to estimates of Î². Price elasticity of demand is typically negative but is reported here as a positive number for convenience.</p>
<p>External sources are varied and often vague in their estimates of price sensitivity of natural gas. Using the reported domestic NG market demand given for 2012 in AEO2014, the Î² values reported here yield an overall NG sector elasticity value of 0.36â0.92 (higher values of Î² correspond to lower elasticity values). Arora <span id="id2318"><a class="reference internal" href="#id304" title="Vipin Arora. Estimates of the price elasticities of natural gas supply and demand in the United States. Technical Report MPRA Paper No. 54232, U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2014.">2014</a></span> estimated the price elasticity of demand for NG to be 0.11â0.70, depending on the granularity and time horizon of the NG price data considered. Bernstein and Griffin <span id="id2319"><a class="reference internal" href="#id364" title="Mark A. Bernstein and James M. Griffin. Regional differences in the price-elasticity of demand for energy. Technical Report NREL/SR-620-39512, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, 2006.">2006</a></span> examined the price elasticity of demand for residential NG usage, and they estimated the long-run elasticity to be 0.12â0.63 depending on the region. The Energy Modeling Forum at Stanford University reports NG price elasticity of demand for 13 different energy models <span id="id2320">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1236" title="Hillard Huntington. EMF 26: Changing the Game? Emissions and Market Implications of New Natural Gas Supplies. Technical Report, Energy Modeling Forum, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 2013.">Huntington, 2013</a>]</span>. The reported elasticity ranges from 0 to 2.20 depending on the year, model, and scenario considered. For the NEMS model, which is used for the AEO, the elasticity ranges from 0.22 to 0.81 depending on the year and scenario <span id="id2321">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1236" title="Hillard Huntington. EMF 26: Changing the Game? Emissions and Market Implications of New Natural Gas Supplies. Technical Report, Energy Modeling Forum, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 2013.">Huntington, 2013</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The EPAâs proposed Clean Power Plan included a projection that natural gas usage will increase by 1.2 quads in 2020, resulting in an 8%â12% increase in NG prices for the electric sector <span id="id2322">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1991" title="S. Smith. EPA: Clean Power Plan could increase power sector gas use by 1.2 Tcf in 2020. SNL Financial, June 2014.">Smith, 2014</a>]</span>. This corresponds to a <em>Î²<sub>nat</sub></em> of 0.38â0.51 in 2004$/MMBtu/quad.</p>
<p><strong>Constant Elasticity of Supply</strong></p>
<p>The second method for representing gas price adjustments leverages a constant elasticity of supply curve for census division prices as a function of the quantities consumed. The general form of the equation relies on a reference price (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{p}\)</span>), a reference quantity (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{q}\)</span>), and a price elasticity of supply (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon\)</span>)<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref66" id="id2323" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>62<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> to determine the endogenous price (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>) based on an endogenous quantity (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>) suchÂ that:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[p = \overline{p}\left( \frac{q}{\overline{q}} \right)^{\epsilon}\]</div>
<p>When parameterizing for the census division representations, the supply curve should reflect the change in price given a change in the census divisionâs quantity consumed in the electricity sector. To the best of our knowledge, no published studies estimate the elasticity of supply for natural gas specific to each sector and region. Therefore, the calibrated curve needs to consider the change in the census divisionâs price given a change in the consumption of natural gas in the regionâs electricity sector with respect to other regions and sectors. To do this, the reference price, numerator, and denominator in the previous equation are adjusted to reflect the consumption change only in the electricity sector. Explicitly, the constant elasticity of supply parameters are now indexed by census division (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>) and sector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s \in \{ electricity,\ \ industrial,\ \ residential,\ \ commercial,\ \ vehicles\}\)</span>). The equation used to populate the supply curve in the model becomes:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[p_{ele,r} = {\overline{p}}_{ele,r}\left( \frac{\sum_{s^{'} \notin ele,r^{'} \notin r}^{}{\overline{q}}_{s^{'},r^{'}} + q_{ele,r}}{\sum_{s,r}^{}{\overline{q}}_{s,r}} \right)^{\epsilon}\]</div>
<p>A potential addition to this representation, included as a switch in the model, also includes national price adjustments as deviations from the reference point. By denoting the national price as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{ele,nat}\)</span>, the deviation from the benchmark price based on national quantities consumed in the electricity sector can be computed as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta p_{ele,nat} = {\overline{p}}_{ele,nat}\left( 1 - \frac{\sum_{s^{'} \notin ele,r}^{}{{\overline{q}}_{s^{'},r} + \sum_{r}^{}q_{ele,r}}}{\sum_{s,r}^{}{\overline{q}}_{s,r}} \right)^{\epsilon}\]</div>

<h3>Seasonal Natural Gas Price Adjustments<a class="headerlink" href="#seasonal-natural-gas-price-adjustments" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>We use natural gas futures prices to estimate the ratio of winter to non-winter natural gas prices to implement seasonal gas price differences in ReEDS. We chose futures prices for two reasons: (1) ReEDS represents a system with no unforeseen disturbances, which is similar to futures prices and (2) historical natural gas prices have fluctuated greatly since the deregulation of natural gas prices.</p>

Wintertime prices are on average 1.054 times higher than non-winter prices.

<p><strong>Construction Cost Multiplier:</strong> The construction cost multiplier (CC<sub>mult</sub>) captures the cost to finance the construction of the plant at construction interest rate <em>i</em>. We use a mid-year discounting and account for the deduction of interest payments for taxes.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[CC_{mult} = 1 + \sum_{t}^{}{x_{t}\  \bullet \left\{ (1\  + \ i)^{t} - \ 1 \right\} \bullet (1 - T)}\]</div>
<p>The derivation of the construction cost multiplier is given below.</p>
<p>The total payment (<em>TP)</em> required to finance <em>x</em> percent of construction investment (<em>Inv</em>) at interest rate <em>i</em> in construction year *tâ*where <em>t</em> is defined relative to the in-service date (t=0 is the final year of construction; t=1 is penultimate year of construction; etc.)âis the following:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[{TP}_{t} = \ x_{t}\  \bullet \ Inv\  \bullet \ (1\  + \ i)^{t}\]</div>
<p>Define the interest payment (<em>I</em>) in year <em>t</em> as a function of the total payment (<em>TP</em>) and the principal payment (<em>P</em>):</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[I_{t}\  = \ {TP}_{t}\  - \ P_{t}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[x_{t}\  \bullet \ Inv\  \bullet \ (1\  + \ i)^{t}\  - \ x_{t}\ *\ Inv\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[x_{t}\  \bullet \ Inv\  \bullet \left\{ (1\  + \ i)^{t}\  - \ 1 \right\}\]</div>
<p>The tax savings (<em>S</em>) from interest deductions in year <em>t</em> at tax rate <em>T</em> is equal to:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[S_{t}\  = \ I_{t}\  \bullet T\]</div>
<p>Therefore, the absolute net change in the investment cost due to construction financing is the interest payments less the tax savings:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta\ cost\ (absolute)\  = \sum_{t}^{}{I_{t} - S_{t}}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[= \sum_{t}^{}{I_{t} - I_{t} \bullet T}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[= \sum_{t}^{}{I_{t} \bullet (1 - T)}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[= \sum_{t}^{}{x_{t}\  \bullet \ Inv\  \bullet \left\{ (1\  + \ i)^{t} - \ 1 \right\} \bullet (1 - T)}\]</div>
<p>Finally, the total relative change in the investment cost due to construction financing is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta\ cost\ (relative)\  = \]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[= \left( Inv + \sum_{t}^{}{I_{t} - S_{t}} \right)\ /\ Inv\ \]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[= 1 + \frac{1}{Inv} \bullet \sum_{t}^{}{x_{t}\  \bullet \ Inv\  \bullet \left\{ (1\  + \ i)^{t} - \ 1 \right\} \bullet (1 - T)}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[= 1 + \sum_{t}^{}{x_{t}\  \bullet \left\{ (1\  + \ i)^{t} - \ 1 \right\} \bullet (1 - T)}\]</div>
<p><strong>Financing Multiplier:</strong> The financing multiplier (not to be confused with the financial multiplier) is an adjustment to reflect either higher or lower returns to capital, relative to the system-wide average return to capital. Conceptually, it is a multiplier that reflects the total present-value of a stream of higher (or lower) payments to capital, relative to what the payments would be at the systemâs average cost of capital. For example, if a technologyâs WACC (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(WACC_{tech})\)</span> is 7% and the system-wide WACC is 5% (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(WACC_{sys})\)</span>, and the technology is being evaluated for a 20-year horizon (l) at a real discount rate of 5% (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{r})\)</span>, the financing multiplier (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({fin}_{mult})\)</span> would be 1.25, per the equation below. This multiplier represents that the total present-value of the returns to capital for this technology must be higher (by an amount equal to 25% of the initial investment), relative to a technology with average financing terms. The difference is the technology WACC and system WACC represents the difference is returns to capital due to diversifiable risk.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[{fin}_{mult} = 1 + \left( WACC_{tech} - WACC_{sys} \right) \bullet \frac{1 - \frac{1}{\left( {1 + d}_{r} \right)^{l}}}{d_{r}}\]</div>
<p>To derive the above equation, begin with the definition of the capital recovery factor (<em>CRF</em>) for real discount rate (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{r})\)</span> and economic horizon (<em>l</em>):</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[CRF = \frac{Annuity}{Present\ Value\ of\ Annunity} = \frac{d_{r}}{1 - \frac{1}{\left( {1 + d}_{r} \right)^{l}}}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Present\ Value\ of\ Annuity = \frac{1}{CRF} \bullet Annuity\]</div>
<p>Therefore, for every dollar invested in a technology, the absolute difference in required return is:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\ returns\ (absolute) = \$ 1 \bullet WACC_{tech} \bullet \frac{1}{CRF} - \$ 1 \bullet WACC_{sys}*\frac{1}{CRF}\)</span></p>
<p>Finally, the relative difference in required return per dollar invested is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta\ returns\ (relative) = \frac{\$ 1 + \Delta}{\$ 1} = 1 + \Delta\]</div>
<p><strong>Depreciation Expense:</strong> The present value of depreciation (PVdepr) expense is computed based on the fraction of the plant value that is depreciable in each year. All investments use a MACRS depreciation schedule with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_{t}^{depr}\)</span> representing deprecation fraction in year t. This depreciation is sheltered from taxes, which is reflected by the term <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 - T*PV_{depr}\)</span> in the financial multiplier equation above.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[PV_{depr} = \sum_{t}^{}{\frac{1}{\left( 1 + d_{n} \right)^{t}} \bullet f_{t}^{depr}}\]</div>
<p><strong>Depreciable Basis:</strong> The eligible cost basis for MACRS depreciation expense is reduced by one-half the effective value of the tax credit:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[PV_{depr}*\left( 1 - \frac{{ITC}_{eff}}{2} \right)\]</div>
<p><strong>Investment Tax Credit:</strong> The value of the ITC is reduced, to reflect the costs of monetizing it (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m_{ITC}\)</span>). The effective investment tax credit value (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({ITC}_{eff})\)</span> reduces the tax burden of the investments.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[{ITC}_{eff} = ITC \bullet m_{ITC}\]</div>
<p><strong>Taxes:</strong> The denominator term of the financial multiplier equation, â1-Tâ, reflects the additional revenues necessary to pay taxes. The tax burden is adjusted for depreciation expenses as well as the effective investment tax credit.</p>
<p><strong>Weighted Average Cost of Capital:</strong> The technology-agnostic, nominal discount rate is represented as the average WACC. Where, d<sub>f</sub> is the debt fraction, <em>rore<sub>n</sub></em> is the nominal rate of return on equity, <em>T</em> is the effective tax rate, and <em>I<sub>n</sub></em> is the nominal interest rate on debt.</p>

<h3>Calculating Present Value of Direct Electric Sector Cost<a class="headerlink" href="#calculating-present-value-of-direct-electric-sector-cost" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>The equations in this section are used to calculate the present value cost of building and operating the system for some defined economic analysis period. To calculate the present value of total system cost, the cost in each future year <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> is discounted to the initial year of the economic analysis period, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{0}\)</span>, by a social discount rate, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{social}\)</span>. The real social discount rate used here for present value calculation is different from the investment discount rate assumptions, or cost of capital (WACC) assumptions.</p>
<p>The present value, or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(PV\)</span> in the equation, consists of two cost components: 1) the present value of all operational costs in the model for the analysis period, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(PV_{operational}\)</span>, including fixed and variable operating and maintenance costs for all sectors, as well as fuel costs and 2) the present value of all new capital investments, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(PV_{capital}\)</span>. The present value of energy system costs is then calculated as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[PV = PV_{operational} + PV_{capital}\]</div>
<p>Operational costs, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(PV_{operational}\)</span>, and capital costs category,<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ PV_{capital}\)</span>, are discounted from year <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{1}{\left( 1 + d_{social} \right)^{t - t_{0}}}\)</span> for each year in the analysis period:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[PV_{operational} = \sum_{t = t_{0}}^{t_{f}}{C_{op,t} \times \frac{1}{\left( 1 + d_{social} \right)^{t - t_{0}}}}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[PV_{capital} = \sum_{t = t_{0}}^{t_{f}}{C_{cap,t} \times \frac{1}{\left( 1 + d_{social} \right)^{t - t_{0}}}}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_{op,t}\)</span> is the operational costs in year t, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_{cap,t}\)</span> is the capital costs in year <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>. For all ReEDS system cost results, we assume the operational costs for the non-modeled year are the same as the closest model year.</p>
<p>In this present value calculation, the economic analysis period is 2018â2050. The social discount rate used for present value calculations, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{social}\)</span>, is assumed to be 7% (real). This is different from the WACC assumption for investment decisions</p>

The primal formulation is:</p>

<p>Constraints [1] define the resource limits for each model plant. Constraints [2] limit how capacity is allocated for each model plant (i.e., for energy or reserves). Constraint [3] requires the total generation supplied to equal the load. Constraint [4] ensures the total firm capacity meets the planning reserve margin requirement. Constraint [5] ensures the total operating reserves meet the operating reserve requirement. Constraint [6] requires that total generation from renewable technologies meets the state-level and national RPS requirements.</p>
<p>From the dual formulation of the primal, the objective function is*:*</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[y^{T}b = y_{1} \bullet s + y_{2} \bullet 0 + y_{3} \bullet load + y_{4} \bullet \frac{(1 + prm)}{8760} \bullet load + y_{5} \bullet f^{or} \bullet load + y_{6} \bullet f^{RPS} \bullet load\]</div>
<p>Reformulating the primal with Constraints [3], [4], [5], and [6] âlinkedâ with a âloadâ variable, <em>L</em>, an alternative, but equivalent, primal formulation is the following:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[L = load\ \ \ \ \ \lbrack 8'\rbrack\]</div>
<p>From the dual formulation of the alternative primal, the objective function is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[y^{T}b = y_{1} \bullet s + y_{2} \bullet 0 + y_{3^{'}} \bullet 0 + y_{4^{'}} \bullet 0 + y_{5^{'}} \bullet 0 + y_{6^{'}} \bullet 0 + y_{8^{'}} \bullet load\]</div>
<p>Equating the dual objective functions from the two equivalent primal formulations, we find that the marginal off the linking constraint [8â] is a blending of all constraints containing the âloadâ variable, including, constraints [3], [4], [5], and [6]:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[y_{8^{'}} \bullet load\mathbf{=}y_{3} \bullet load + y_{4} \bullet \frac{\left( 1 + f^{prm} \right)}{8760} \bullet load + y_{5} \bullet f^{or} \bullet load + y_{6} \bullet f^{RPS} \bullet load\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[y_{8^{'}} = y_{3} + y_{4} \bullet \frac{\left( 1 + f^{prm} \right)}{8760} + y_{5} \bullet f^{or} + y_{6} \bullet f^{RPS}\]</div>
<p>Therefore, we define the marginal off the linking constraint <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lbrack y_{8^{'}}\rbrack\)</span> as the âall-inâ marginal price of electricity (i.e., change in total cost [objective function] given a small change in load). This marginal electricity price includes the energy price, capacity price, operating reserve prices, and potential RPS prices. Marginal electricity prices are reported at BA level with different requirement categories. These prices can be aggregated at different regional level, weighted by corresponding requirement quantities for certain category.</p>

<h3>Average Electricity Prices<a class="headerlink" href="#average-electricity-prices" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>Average electricity prices are calculated as the annualized total costs of building and operating the system in certain geographic area, divided by the electricity load in that area. At national level, the prices are calculated as:</p>

<section id="spatial-resolution-capabilities">
<h3>Spatial Resolution Capabilities<a class="headerlink" href="#spatial-resolution-capabilities" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h3>
<p>The ReEDS model has four default spatial resolutions, shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-available-region-options"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 56</span></a>. The default settings use the model balancing areas (bottom left of <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-available-region-options"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 56</span></a>). The model also includes a custom aggregation capability that enables users to select any aggregation of regions built from counties or balancing areas. National-scale county-level resolution runs are extremely computationally intensive, so require simplifications in other aspects of the model (e.g., fewer timesteps, solve years, or technologies) to be able to produce a solution, and even with simplifications it requires hundreds of gigabytes of memory to process the county-level inputs. Any runs that use aggregated states require that state policies be turned off because the model does not have any built-in features for aggregating state policies for states that have been combined.</p>

</figure>
<p>The spatial framework built into the ReEDS model allows for other spatial resolutions. For example, nodal datasets can be represented in the model. When running with nodal data, each renewable energy resource site can only be associated with a single node, so the node assignments have to be done before a model run is performed.</p>
<p>The model also has the capability to use mixed resolutions. For example, California can be represented using model balancing areas, while the rest of the United States is represented at state resolution. This can enable finer detail for a specific region of interest, while still capturing trades with neighboring regions as lower resolution, but with a reasonable solution time.</p>

<h4>Transmission Data<a class="headerlink" href="#transmission-data" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>

Nodes from the data set are spatially matched to counties using nodal coordinates and a shapefile of U.S. counties (described below). With this dataset there are a few dozen counties that have no transmission nodes or capacity, which may be the result of missing data. To address this, nodes and lines are added to ensure that every county has at least one transmission interface. This is done by either adding a node on existing lines that cross a county but did previously have nodes in that county, or if there are no transiting lines by adding a node to the county centroid and matching to the closest node in a neighboring county.</p>

<p>Power flow constraints imposed by the topology of the network can limit the true transfer capacity between two counties to a level below the physical capacity of the lines connecting those counties. ReEDS estimates these interface capacity limits using an optimization method that finds the maximum transfer values given network characteristics, the location of generators and load, and other constraints <span id="id2327">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id458" title="Patrick R. Brown, Clayton P. Barrows, Jarrad G. Wright, Gregory L. Brinkman, Sourabh Dalvi, Jiazi Zhang, and Trieu Mai. A general method for estimating zonal transmission interface limits from nodal network data. August 2023. arXiv:2308.03612.">Brown <em>et al.</em>, 2023</a>]</span>. Because interface limits are typically less influenced by parts of the network that are further away, the method is run on a subset of the network. This subset is selected by including all parts of the network that are a specified number of âhopsâ away from the interface being optimized. A comparison of the results from the optimization method with different hops found that total transfer capacity saturated after 6 hops, so this value was used when calculating the county-level transfer limits used in ReEDS. Since the transfer capacity can differ depending on the direction, the optimization is run once in each direction (forward and reverse) for each interface. Further information on the development of county-level transmission interfaces is provided by Sergi et al. <span id="id2328"><a class="reference internal" href="#id1951" title="Brian Sergi, Patrick Brown, and Wesley Cole.

<p>After the optimization, some counties have zero transfer capacity in one or both directions; these are replaced with either the transfer capacity estimated in the other direction if it is non-zero or the thermal capacity of the line. To estimate metrics such as TW-mi of transfer capacity, ReEDS uses the distance between the centroids of the two counties in the interface.

Each supply curve point from the reV model is mapped directly to its corresponding county. These supply curve points are then aggregated by ReEDS to produce county level supply curves.</p>
<p>The reV model includes estimates of the cost of investments needed to reinforce the transmission network with the addition of more wind and solar. For the ReEDS balancing area spatial representation, these network reinforcement costs are calculated by determining the least cost interconnection point and then estimating the transmission upgrades needed between that point and balancing areaâs interregional network node. Since the county-level resolution now explicitly represents transmission investments between counties, the network reinforcement costs from reV are not included in the transmission cost estimates of the county supply curves. Spur line costs, or the cost to build from the resource site to the interconnection point, are still taken from reV. In the future the reV model may be adapted to produce network reinforcement costs at the county level, though they might be sufficiently small that ignoring them would be appropriate.</p>

<p>Since only one county exists in the ReEDS BA âp29,â the population fraction for that county is 1. On the other hand, two counties exist in the ReEDS BA âp30â: the population fractions show that 95.6% of the population of p30 live in county p04019, while 4.4% of the population lives in p04023. To disaggregate by population, the dataset is mapped to regionally-indexed BA-level ReEDS input data and the Population Fraction is multiplied by the values of the BA-level dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Downscaling based on geographic size:</strong></p>
<p>The geographic size disaggregation method operates similarly to the âpopulationâ disaggregation method but instead uses the fraction of a countyâs geographic area with respect to its corresponding ReEDS BA as fractional multipliers for downscaling BA-level input data to county level. Geographic area data used to create the multipliers are sourced from the 2022 TIGER/Line US County Shapefile provided by the US Census Bureau [link] and found in the inputs folder of the ReEDS repository.</p>
<p><strong>Downscaling based on the existing hydropower capacity:</strong></p>
<p>The existing hydropower disaggregation method uses the fraction of existing hydropower capacity in a given county with respect to the total hydropower capacity of the countyâs corresponding ReEDS BA as fractional multipliers for downscaling BA-level input data to county level. Existing hydropower capacity data used to calculate these fractional multipliers are sourced from the EIA-NEMS generator database included in the ReEDS inputs. This down-scaling method is used for hydropower-specific data, such as hydropower upgrades.</p>
<p><strong>Downscaling based on transmission line size:</strong></p>
<p>Fractional multipliers used in the transmission line size disaggregation method represents the ratio of transmission capacity between a given US county and a Canadian balancing area in relation to the total transmission capacity of the countyâs corresponding US balancing area. As an example: if US balancing area p1 is comprised of 2 counties, and 300 MW of transmission capacity exists between county 1 and the Canadian balancing area and 100 MW of transmission capacity exists between county 2 and Canadian balancing area, then the ratio of 3/4 (0.75) is used to disaggregate data between county 1 and the Canadian balancing area while a ratio of 1/4 (0.25) is used to disaggregate data between county 2 and the Canadian balancing area. Transmission data used to create these multipliers are sourced from the same nodal dataset used to create the transmission interface limits described above. Note that transmission lines found in the source data are considered to be bidirectional: therefore, when calculating the total transmission capacity between a US BA and Canadian BA both directions must be considered. This down-scaling method is applied to Canadian import and export inputs.</p>
<p>We selected one of the 5 downscaling methods above for each of the inputs that included a spatial dimension. The choice was made using analyst judgement. The input structure of ReEDS is such that if an appropriate county-level dataset becomes available, it can be used in place of the downscaled dataset.</p>
</section>
<section id="input-data-handling">
<h4>Input Data Handling<a class="headerlink" href="#input-data-handling" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>Because some input data are specified at both the balancing area resolution and the county resolution, the inputs used for a given run will depend on the spatial resolution selected for that run. The input scripts include logic that will read in the file with the appropriate spatial resolution, and use that for the remainder of the run. In the case of mixed resolutions, both files will be read in, and the appropriate regions will be concatenated to create a single input file with the specified spatial resolutions.</p>
<p>ReEDS has been set up to run so that only data for the regions being modeled will be included in the model. For example, if doing a run that includes only the state of North Dakota, the inputs processing step of ReEDS will filter all input data to include only the data for North Dakota.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref69" id="id2332" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>65<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>Spatial datasets are dynamic within the model itself, so the model is agnostic to the region names.</p>
</section>
<section id="challenges-and-benefits-of-enhanced-spatial-resolution">
<h4>Challenges and Benefits of Enhanced Spatial Resolution<a class="headerlink" href="#challenges-and-benefits-of-enhanced-spatial-resolution" title="Link to this heading">ï</a></h4>
<p>The greater spatial resolution available in ReEDS with county-level inputs creates a variety of opportunities to apply the ReEDS model to answer questions. It enables specific regions of the country to be captured to greater resolution, enabling more granular outputs of power plant siting, transmission expansion, and emission impacts. The higher resolution can also highlight key regional boundaries or interfaces that might not have been present in a lower resolution model run. Our testing has also shown that county-level resolution can lead to better estimates of curtailment because there is more detail on the underlying transmission system.</p>
<p>The enhanced spatial resolution also comes with a variety of challenges. These include runtime, especially as the number of regions considered grows. Much of our testing showed that a 10-fold increase in the number of regions led to at least a 10-fold increase in solve time, though runtime ultimately depends on the machine specifications and the model options selected for that particular run. Another major challenge is sourcing appropriate input data. If the down-scaling methods described above are not suitable for answering the questions of a particular analysis, then new data will be to be procured. Additionally, even the best transmission datasets we had available still had omissions, so it is unclear if key data will be missing for studying a particular region.</p>
<p>Finally, enhanced spatial resolution can lead to false precision, where users see model solutions at high spatial resolution, and put more stock into that model solution than is warranted due to uncertainty in the data or methods used. For example, Mehrtash et al. <span id="id2333"><a class="reference internal" href="#id1577" title="Mahdi Mehrtash, Benjamin F. Hobbs, Reza Mahroo, and Yankai Cao. Does Choice of Power Flow Representation Matter in Transmission Expansion Optimization? A Quantitative Comparison for a Large-Scale Test System. IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 2023.">2023</a></span> show that the choice of transmission power flow representation can have significant impact on the model solution.</p>

<p>CCS projects are eligible for a direct pay option for the first 5 years of the 45Q credit or until 2032 (whichever comes first), with the credits returning to non-refundable status after that point. The lower monetization penalty is meant to approximate the benefit of the direct pay option.</p>

<p>To provide ReEDS with foresight to know that the phaseout is coming in Virginia, we implement an increasing capital cost financing multiplier to plants that are being phased out. This multiplier shortens the cost recovery period of the plant. For example, when evaluating whether to build a Gas-CC unit in 2040 (5 years before the scheduled phaseout), the financial multiplier for Gas-CC includes a 5-year cost recovery period.</p>

<p>The long-run marginal emission rate is a metric designed to help estimate the emissions induced (or avoided) by a persistent change in electricity consumption. Unlike the short-run marginal emission rate, the long-run marginal emission rate reflects the structural changes to the grid that can be induced by a persistent change in electricity consumption.</p>
