<h2>Acknowledgments<a class="headerlink" href="#acknowledgments" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We gratefully acknowledge the many people whose efforts contributed to this model and its documentation.
The Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) modeling and analysis team at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is active in developing and testing the ReEDS model version with each release.
We also acknowledge the vast number of current and past NREL employees on and beyond the ReEDS team who have participated in data and model development, testing, and analysis.
We are especially grateful to Walter Short who first envisioned and developed the Wind Deployment System (WinDS) and ReEDS models.
Finally, we are grateful to all those who helped sponsor ReEDS model development and analysis, particularly supporters from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) but also others who have funded our work over the years.</p>

<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>This documentation describes the structure and key data elements of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/">Regional Energy Deployment System</a> (ReEDS) model, which is maintained and operated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
In this introduction, we provide a high-level overview of ReEDS objectives, capabilities, and applications.
We also provide a short discussion of important caveats that apply to any ReEDS analysis.</p>
<p>The ReEDS model code and input data can be accessed at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NREL/ReEDS-2.0">https://github.com/NREL/ReEDS-2.0</a>.</p>
<section id="overview">
<h3>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>ReEDS is a mathematical programming model of the electric power sector.
Given a set of input assumptions, ReEDS models the evolution and operation of generation, storage, transmission, and production<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref2" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> technologies.
The results can be used to explore the impacts of a variety of future technological and policy scenarios on, for example, economic and environmental outcomes for the entire power sector or for specific stakeholders.</p>
<p>The electricity system is represented in the model by separating the system into model regions, each of which has sources of supply and demand.
Regions are connected by a representation of the transmission network, which includes existing transmission capacity and endogenous new capacity.
The model represents all existing generating units, planned future builds, and endogenous new capacity within each region.
The model is intended to solve on the decadal scale, although the time horizon for a particular model run (and the intervening model solve years) can be selected by the user.
Within each year, selected representative periods are used to characterize seasonal and diurnal patterns in supply and demand (with the option to run with all hours if computational bandwidth allows).
In addition, grid reliability is represented using stress periods and linkages to the Probabilistic Resource Adequacy Suite (PRAS) model <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2115" title="Gord Stephen.

<h3>ReEDS History<a class="headerlink" href="#reeds-history" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The ReEDS model heritage traces back to NREL’s original electric sector capacity expansion model, called the Wind Deployment System (WinDS) model.
The WinDS model was developed beginning in 2001 to examine the long-term market potential of wind in the electric power sector <span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2054" title="Walter Short, Nate Blair, Donna Heimiller, and Vikram Singh. Modeling the Long-Term Market Penetration of Wind in the United States. Technical Report NREL/CP-620-34469, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, 2003. URL: http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy03osti/34469.pdf.">Short <em>et al.</em>, 2003</a>]</span>.
From 2003 to 2008, WinDS was used in a variety of wind-related analyses,
including the production of hydrogen from wind power,
the impacts of state-level policies on wind deployment,
the role of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in wind markets,
the impacts of high wind deployment on U.S. wind manufacturing,
the potential for offshore wind,
the benefits of storage to wind power,
and the feasibility of producing 20% of U.S. electricity from wind power by 2030 <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id760" title="DOE. 20% Wind Energy by 2030: Increasing Wind Energy's Contribution to U.S. Electricity Supply.

In 2006, a variation of WinDS was developed to analyze concentrating solar power (CSP) potential and its response to state and federal incentives.
In 2009, WinDS was recast as ReEDS—a generalized tool for examining the long-term deployment interactions of multiple technologies in the power sector <span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id421" title="Nate Blair, Thomas Jenkin, James Milford, Walter Short, Patrick Sullivan, David Evans, Elliot Lieberman, Gary Goldstein, Evelyn Wright, Kamala R.

<section id="summary-of-caveats">
<h3>Summary of Caveats<a class="headerlink" href="#summary-of-caveats" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Although ReEDS represents many aspects of the U.S. electricity system, it requires simplifications, as all models do.
Following are some important limitations and caveats that result from these simplifications:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Systemwide optimization:</strong> ReEDS takes a systemwide, least-cost perspective that does not necessarily reflect the perspectives of individual decision makers, including specific investors, regional market participants, or corporate or individual consumers; nor does it model contractual obligations or noneconomic decisions.
In addition, like other optimization models, ReEDS finds the absolute (deterministic) least-cost solution that does not fully reflect real distributions or uncertainties in the parameters; however, the heterogeneity resulting from the high spatial resolution of ReEDS mitigates this effect to some degree.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resolution:</strong> Although ReEDS has high spatial, temporal, and process resolution for models of its class and scope, it cannot generally represent individual units and transmission lines, and it does not have the temporal resolution to characterize detailed operating behaviors, such as ramp rates and minimum plant runtime.
It also generally samples only representative time periods within a year rather than modeling all hours in a year because of computational challenges.
The linkage with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NREL/PRAS">PRAS</a>, which includes chronological hourly modeling for multiple years, helps ensure the ReEDS portfolios meet specified resource adequacy levels.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Foresight and behavior:</strong> ReEDS solve years are evaluated sequentially and myopically.
The model has limited foresight and its decision making does not account for anticipated changes to markets and policies.
For example, ReEDS typically does not endogenously model the banking and borrowing of credits for carbon, renewable, or clean energy policy between solve years.
In addition, ReEDS’ dispatch modeling does not explicitly consider forecast errors, although operating reserves can be modeled.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Project pipeline:</strong> The model incorporates data of planned or under-construction projects, but these data do not include <em>all</em> projects in progress.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Manufacturing, supply chain, and siting:</strong> The model does not explicitly simulate manufacturing, supply chain, or siting and permitting processes.
Potential bottlenecks or delays in project development stages for new generation or transmission are not fully reflected in the results.
All technologies are assumed to be available at their defined capital cost in any quantity up to their technical resource potential.
Penalties for rapid growth can be applied in ReEDS; however, these do not fully consider all potential manufacturing or deployment limits.
Dates associated with cost inputs in the model reflect project costs for the commercial operation date but not necessarily when equipment is ordered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Financing:</strong> Although the model can use annually varying financing parameters to capture near-term market conditions and technology-specific financing to account for differences in typical investment strategies across technologies,
ReEDS cannot fully represent differences in project financing terms across markets or ownership types and thus does not allow multiple financing options for a given technology or between regions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology learning:</strong> Future technology improvements are considered exogenously and thus are not a function of deployment in each scenario.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Power sector:</strong> ReEDS models only the power sector within its defined regional scope (CONUS), and it does not represent the broader U.S. or global energy economy.
For example, competing uses of resources (e.g., natural gas) across sectors are not dynamically represented in ReEDS, and end-use electricity demand or nonpower H<sub>2</sub> demand are exogenous inputs to ReEDS.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Notwithstanding these limitations—many of which exist in other similar tools—the modeling approach considers complex interactions among numerous policies and technologies while ensuring electric system reliability requirements are maintained within the resolution and scope of the model.
In doing so, ReEDS can comprehensively estimate the system cost and value of a wide range of technology options given a set of assumptions, and we can use the model to generate self-consistent future deployment portfolios.</p>

<h3>Model Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#model-structure" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>ReEDS is run sequentially, where the optimal system design is identified for each solve year at a time starting in the initial year and through a final year (e.g., 2050).
The increments between solve years are user defined, but most studies use 2-year, 3-year, or 5-year increments.
Increments can also vary between different solve years; e.g., annual increments can be used in the near term followed by multiyear increments in the latter years.
<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-reeds-pras"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 16</span></a> illustrates the model’s sequential structure.
For a given solve year <em>t</em>, ReEDS iterates with the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NREL/PRAS">PRAS</a> model to dynamically update stress periods and check for reliability (see more in <a class="reference internal" href="#resource-adequacy"><span class="xref myst">Resource Adequacy</span></a>).
Once the system design is found to be resource adequate, ReEDS advances to the next model solve year (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t + \Delta t\)</span>).</p>

<h3>Model Formulation<a class="headerlink" href="#model-formulation" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>ReEDS uses a linear program that governs the evolution and operation of the generation and transmission system.
It seeks to minimize power sector costs as it makes various operational and investment decisions, subject to a set of constraints on those decisions.</p>
<p>The objective function is a minimization of both capital and operating costs for the U.S. electric sector, including the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The present value of the cost of adding or upgrading new generation, storage, and transmission capacity (including project financing)</p></li>
<li><p>The present value of operating expenses over the evaluation period<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref6" id="id22" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> (e.g., expenditures for fuel and operations and maintenance [O&amp;M]) for all installed capacity</p></li>
<li><p>The cost of several categories of ancillary services and storage</p></li>
<li><p>The cost of production technologies (e.g., hydrogen), direct air capture, and CO<sub>2</sub> pipelines and storage</p></li>
<li><p>The cost of water access (if water resource constraints are active)</p></li>
<li><p>The cost or incentive applied by any policies that directly charge or credit generation or capacity</p></li>
<li><p>Penalties for rapid capacity growth as a proxy for manufacturing, supply chain, and siting/permitting limitations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By minimizing these costs and meeting the system constraints (discussed below), the linear program determines the types of new capacity to construct (and existing capacity to retire) in each region during each model year to minimize systemwide cost.
Simultaneously, the linear program determines how generation and storage capacity should be dispatched to provide the necessary grid services for all periods.
The capacity factor for each technology, therefore, is an output of the model and not an input assumption.</p>
<p>The constraints that govern how ReEDS builds and operates capacity fall into several main categories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Load balance constraints:</strong> Sufficient power must be generated within or imported by the transmission system to meet the projected load in each of the model zones in each of time steps during representative periods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resource adequacy constraints:</strong> Resource adequacy is a component of reliability that ensures sufficient available capacity to meet forecasted demand in all hours while accounting for outages and demand forecast errors.
Constraints to meet resource adequacy requirements are applied during the “stress periods” and based on the linkage between ReEDS and PRAS as described in the <a class="reference internal" href="#resource-adequacy"><span class="xref myst">Resource Adequacy</span></a> section.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operating reserve constraints:</strong> For shorter timescales, unexpected changes in generation and load are handled by the operating reserve requirements, which are applied for each reserve-sharing group (<a class="reference internal" href="#operational-reliability"><span class="xref myst">Operational Reliability</span></a>).
ReEDS can account for the following operating reserve requirements: regulation reserves, spinning reserves, and flexibility reserves.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Generator operating constraints:</strong> Technology-specific constraints bound the minimum and maximum power production and capacity commitment based on physical limitations and assumed average outage rates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transmission constraints:</strong> Power transfers among regions are constrained by the nominal carrying capacity of transmission corridors that connect the regions.
Transmission constraints also apply to reserve sharing.
A detailed description of the transmission constraints can be found in <a class="reference internal" href="#transmission"><span class="xref myst">Transmission</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resource constraints:</strong> Many renewable technologies, including wind, solar, geothermal, biopower, and hydropower, are spatially heterogeneous and constrained by the quantity available at each location.
Several of the technologies include cost- and resource-quality considerations in resource supply curves to account for depletion, transmission, and competition effects.
The resource assessments that seed the supply curves come from various sources; these are discussed in <a class="reference internal" href="#generation-and-storage-technologies"><span class="xref myst">Generation and Storage Technologies</span></a>, where characteristics of each technology are also provided.
CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration and water resource constraints are also represented.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Emissions constraints:</strong> ReEDS can limit or cap the emissions from fossil-fueled generators for sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e), which includes CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O.
The emission limit and the emission per megawatt-hour by fuel and plant type are inputs to the model.
Negative emissions are allowed using biomass with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) or direct air capture (DAC), and the emission constraint is based on net emissions.
Emissions can be capped or taxed, with flexibility for applying either.
Alternatively, emissions intensities can also be limited to certain bounds in ReEDS.
The emissions constraints can be applied to stack emissions, or can be based on CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emissions, with the latter including precombustion emissions and emissions from upstream methane leakage (see the <a class="reference internal" href="#air-pollution"><span class="xref myst">Air Pollution</span></a> section).<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref8" id="id23" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>3<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>
Methane leakage rates are input by the user.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Renewable portfolio standards or clean electricity standards:</strong> ReEDS can represent renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) and clean electricity standards constraints at the national and state levels.
All renewable generation is considered eligible under a national RPS requirement.
The renewable generation sources include hydropower, wind, CSP, geothermal, photovoltaics (PV), and biopower (including the biomass fraction of cofiring plants).
The eligibility of technologies for state RPSs depends on the state’s specific requirements and thus varies by state.
RPS targets over time are based on an externally defined profile.
Penalties for noncompliance can be imposed for each megawatt-hour shortfall occurring in the country or a given state.
In the same way, a clean energy standard constraint can be implemented to include nonrenewable low-emissions energy resources, such as nuclear and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage (CCS) (<a class="reference internal" href="#clean-energy-standards"><span class="xref myst">Clean Energy Standards</span></a>).</p></li>

<h3>Spatial Resolution<a class="headerlink" href="#spatial-resolution" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>ReEDS is typically used to study the CONUS.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref9" id="id24" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>4<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>
Within the CONUS, ReEDS uses 134 regions for input data but by default runs the model using 132 regions (with region p119 aggregated into p122 and region p30 aggregated into p28).
ReEDS model regions can be seen in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-hierarchy"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 17</span></a>.
The model zones comprise groups of counties and do not align perfectly with real balancing authority areas.
The zones respect state boundaries, allowing the model to represent individual state regulations and incentives.
Transmission flows across the roughly 300 interfaces between model zones are subject to transfer limits, as discussed in the <a class="reference internal" href="#transmission"><span class="xref myst">Transmission</span></a> section.
Additional geographical layers used to define model characteristics include 3 synchronous interconnections,
18 planning subregions designed after existing regional transmission organizations (RTOs),
13 North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) reliability subregions,
9 census divisions as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau,
and 48 states.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref10" id="id25" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>5<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>
The spatial configuration in the model is flexible so the model can be run at various resolutions (i.e., aggregations of model zones), and data within the model are filtered to include data only for the regions being modeled in a given scenario.</p>

Given the high spatial resolution, large number of technologies, and multidecadal time horizon used in ReEDS,
these temporal inputs—and the temporal resolution used within the linear optimization—must be simplified to achieve a tractable model size.
Two methods of time series aggregation are combined in ReEDS:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A reduced number of <strong>representative periods</strong> (33 days by default) is selected and weighted to minimize deviation in regional wind and solar capacity factors and electricity demand between the weighted representative periods and complete time series.</p></li>
<li><p>Within the representative periods, hours are combined into <strong>chunks</strong> (of 3-hour duration by default), with operational constraints (such as chronological energy balancing for storage) acting on the aggregated chunks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>ReEDs allows 1-day or 5-day periods, with 1-day periods used by default (“periods” and “days” are hereafter used interchangeably).

<h4>Representative periods<a class="headerlink" href="#representative-periods" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Various methods are used for representative period selection in the literature (reviewed, for example, by <span id="id27">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2153" title="Holger Teichgraeber and Adam R. Brandt. Time-series aggregation for the optimization of energy systems: Goals, challenges, approaches, and opportunities. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 157:111984, April 2022.

ReEDS includes options based on hierarchical clustering, k-means and k-medoids clustering, and an interregional optimization approach described by <span id="id28">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id485" title="Patrick R. Brown, Wesley J. Cole, and Trieu Mai. An interregional optimization approach for time series aggregation in continent-scale electricity system models. Energy, pages 135830, April 2025. URL: https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0360544225014720 (visited on 2025-04-08), doi:10.1016/j.energy.2025.135830.">Brown <em>et al.</em>, 2025</a>]</span>.
The optimization approach is used by default and is briefly described here.</p>
<p>The optimized method considers three “features” (wind capacity factor, solar capacity factor, and electricity demand)
and their daily average values over a user-specified number of regions.
The 18 planning subregions shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-hierarchy"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 17</span></a> are used by default, resulting in 3 × 18 = 54 combinations of features and regions.
The two-step optimization method is illustrated graphically in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-temporal-repdays"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 20</span></a>.
First, a linear optimization is performed to identify a set of daily “weights” that,
when multiplied by the observed daily feature values in each region and summed over the year,
minimizes the error in weighted average regional feature values compared to their full-year values (<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-temporal-repdays"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 20</span></a><strong>a</strong>).
The weights are truncated to a user-specified number of representative days (35 in this example),
then rescaled and rounded to integers (<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-temporal-repdays"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 20</span></a><strong>b</strong>),
giving the number of times each representative day is to be used over the modeled weather year(s).
(In this example, December 23 is used 29 times, September 8 is used 3 times, and so on.)</p>
<p>Because some aspects of system operations are modeled with interday constraints (discussed below),
each actual day must then be mapped to one of the modeled representative days,
allowing a reconstructed chronological representation of the year (<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-temporal-repdays"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 20</span></a><strong>c</strong>).
This mapping is performed in a second optimization,
formulated as a mixed integer/linear problem (MILP),
to minimize the sum of absolute differences between each day’s actual regional feature values and the feature values on the representative day to which it is mapped.</p>

<h4>Weather years<a class="headerlink" href="#weather-years" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>ReEDS distinguishes between future <strong>model years</strong> (also referred to as <strong>solve years</strong>) during which operations and investments are optimized
and <strong>weather years</strong> associated with hourly capacity factor and electricity demand profiles.
These sets of years are entirely independent:
Multiple weather years are used for resource adequacy calculations in each model year (for example, the modeled capacity mix in 2030 may be assessed against 2007–2013 weather),
and the weather years are held fixed for each model year (so the 2030 and 2050 model years may both use 2007–2013 weather years for resource adequacy calculations).</p>
<p>Weather years are used differently for <a class="reference internal" href="#representative-periods"><span class="xref myst">representative periods</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#resource-adequacy"><span class="xref myst">resource adequacy</span></a> calculations.
By default, representative periods are drawn from the single 2012 weather year,
whereas resource adequacy calculations use the 7 weather years spanning 2007–2013.
The default 2007–2013 weather years are defined by the temporal scope of the Wind Integration National Dataset (WIND) Toolkit <span id="id31">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2337" title="National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Wind Integration National Dataset Toolkits. 2024. URL: https://www.nrel.gov/grid/wind-toolkit.html.">National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 2024</a>]</span>, which is used to calculate hourly wind capacity factors.
Alternative weather profiles may be provided by the user,
but the allowable weather years are constrained by the need for coincident hourly profiles for PV and wind capacity factors, electricity demand, and surface air temperature (used in the calculation of <a class="reference internal" href="#outage-rates"><span class="xref myst">outage rates</span></a>) for all model zones.
The hourly wind and solar datasets in ReEDS include profiles for weather years 2007–2013 and 2016–2023.

<h5>Unit commitment approximations<a class="headerlink" href="#unit-commitment-approximations" title="Link to this heading"></a></h5>
<p>As a linear optimization problem, ReEDS does not directly model unit commitment.
For a subset of technologies for which unit startup costs are expected to significantly affect aggregate fleetwide operations, two approximation methods are used by default:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Nuclear generation technologies are modeled with a fixed minimum generation level, set to 70% for conventional nuclear and 40% for small modular reactors (SMRs).
(Forced and scheduled outages, discussed in the <a class="reference internal" href="#outage-rates"><span class="xref myst">Outage rates</span></a> section, still occur and are not subject to the minimum-generation constraint.)</p></li>
<li><p>For coal and CCS (both gas-CCS and coal-CCS), a linearized startup cost is applied based on the difference in dispatched generation between each pair of consecutive time chunks, including pairs of time chunks between different actual (not representative) periods.
For example, in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-temporal-repdays"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 20</span></a><strong>c</strong>, the 6/18 representative day has a weight of 5 and is followed by another 6/18 representative day three times, by 5/5 one time, and by 5/16 one time.
Ramps between the first and second time chunk of 6/18 are thus counted 5 times; ramps from the last time chunk of 6/18 to the first time chunk of 6/18 are counted three times, ramps from the last time chunk of 6/18 to the first time chunk of 5/5 are weighted one time, and so on.</p></li>

<section id="offshore-wind">
<h4>Offshore Wind<a class="headerlink" href="#offshore-wind" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>ReEDS represents two offshore wind technologies: fixed and floating.
Base cost and performance assumptions in ReEDS for the two technologies are based on one reference fixed offshore site in New York Bight and one reference floating offshore site in Humboldt County, California, including capital costs, FOM costs, and average capacity factor improvements over time.</p>
<p>There is substantial diversity in offshore wind generators, in distance from shore, water depth, and resource quality.
ReEDS subdivides offshore wind potential into 10 resource classes: 5 each for fixed-bottom and floating turbine designs.
Fixed-bottom offshore wind development is limited to resources &lt;60 meters (m) in depth using either current technology monopile foundations (0–30 m) or jacket (truss-style) foundations (30–60 m).
Offshore wind using a floating anchorage could be developed for greater depths and are assumed to be the only feasible technology for development for resource deeper than 60 m.
Within each category, the classes are distinguished by resource quality; supply curves then differentiate resource by cost of accessing transmission in a similar fashion as land-based wind but using five cost bins per region and class.</p>
<p>Eligible offshore area for wind development includes open water within the U.S.-exclusive economic zone having a water depth less than 1,000 m, including the Great Lakes.
As with land-based resource, offshore zones are filtered to remove areas considered unsuitable for development, including national marine sanctuaries, marine protected areas, wildlife refuges, shipping and towing lanes, offshore platforms, and ocean pipelines.
The offshore technology selection is made using the Offshore Wind Cost Model, which selects the most economically feasible technology for developing a wind resource <span id="id39">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id384" title="Philipp Beiter and Tyler Stehly.

<h5>PV + battery hybrids<a class="headerlink" href="#pv-battery-hybrids" title="Link to this heading"></a></h5>
<p>For hybrid systems, the default technology represents a loosely DC-coupled system in which the PV and battery technologies share a bidirectional inverter and POI, and the battery can charge from either the coupled PV or the grid.
The PVB design characteristics can be user defined for up to three configurations, but the default configuration involves an inverter loading ratio of 2.2 (slightly higher than stand-alone PV) and a coupled battery with a preset duration, whose power-rated capacity is 50% of the inverter capacity.
The PVB duration default is 4 hours and can be adjusted using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_PVB_Dur</span></code>.</p>
<p>The PVB investment option leverages the existing representations of the independent component technologies, but the cost and performance characteristics differ from the simple sum of the separate (PV and battery) parts.
For example, the capital costs associated with the fully integrated PVB hybrid system are reduced based on the cost of a shared inverter and other balance-of-system components; as a result, the percentage savings vary by PVB configuration.
Improved performance characteristics are captured through slightly enhanced battery round-trip efficiencies and explicit time series generation profiles; the latter enables a representation of the PVB system’s ability to divert otherwise clipped energy to the coupled battery (during periods when solar output exceeds the inverter capacity) and avoid curtailment.</p>

<p>Rooftop PV includes commercial, industrial, and residential systems.
These systems are assumed to have an inverter loading ratio (ILR) of 1.1.
Existing rooftop PV capacities are obtained from U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)-861 data spanning 2010 to 2022 <span id="id50">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id841" title="EIA.

dGen, a consumer adoption model for the CONUS rooftop PV market, is used to develop future scenarios for rooftop PV capacity, including the capacity deployed by zone and the precurtailment energy production by that capacity <span id="id51">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2059" title="Benjamin Sigrin, Michael Gleason, Robert Preus, Ian Baring-Gould, and Robert Margolis.

ReEDS makes available several potential trajectories for distPV adoption, governed by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">distpvscen</span></code> switch.
These trajectories were created by running a ReEDS scenario and feeding the electricity price outputs from ReEDS back into dGen.
The trajectories incorporate existing net metering policy as of spring 2023, and they include the ITC as discussed in the <a class="reference internal" href="#federal-and-state-tax-incentives"><span class="xref myst">Federal and State Tax Incentives</span></a> section.
To mitigate excessive wheeling of distributed PV generation, ReEDS assumes all power generated by rooftop PV systems is permitted to be exported to neighboring zones only when total generation in the source region exceeds the load for a given time slice.
UPV-generated electricity, in contrast, can be exported in all time slices and regions.</p>
<p>Assumptions for each dGen scenario are made consistent with the ReEDS scenario assumptions as much as possible.
For example, the Tax Credit Extension scenario also includes an extension of the ITC in dGen, and the Low PV Cost scenario uses the low cost trajectory from the ATB for commercial and rooftop PV costs.</p>
<p>reV produces hourly generation profiles for all <a class="reference internal" href="#weather-years"><span class="xref myst">weather years</span></a> using the NSRDB point closest to the centroid of each county in the CONUS.
The profiles represent residential and commercial systems with a 16° tilt and 180° azimuth.
The residential profiles assume an inverter efficiency of 96%, and the commerical profiles assume an inverter efficiency of 98%.
To create a single profile for each region, we determine the NSRDB point(s) existing in or, if none exists, closest to the region and take the average of the corresponding profiles.</p>

<p>The three default CSP resource classes are defined by power density of DNI, developable land area having been filtered based on land cover type, slope, and protected status.
CSP resource in each region is represented by the same supply curve as UPV in (<a class="reference internal" href="#solar-photovoltaics"><span class="xref myst">Solar Photovoltaics</span></a>).

<section id="geothermal">
<h4>Geothermal<a class="headerlink" href="#geothermal" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>The geothermal resource has two distinct subcategories in ReEDS:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The hydrothermal resource represents potential sites with appropriate geological characteristics for the extraction of heat energy.
The hydrothermal potential included in the base supply curve comprises only identified sites, with a separate supply curve representing the undiscovered hydrothermal resource.</p></li>
<li><p>EGS sites are geothermal resources that have sufficient temperature but lack the natural permeability, in situ fluids, or both, to be hydrothermal systems.
Developing these sites with water injection wells could create engineered geothermal reservoirs appropriate for harvesting heat.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>EGS is further separated into near-field EGS and deep EGS based on proximity to known hydrothermal features.
Near-field EGS represents additional geothermal resource available near hydrothermal fields that have been identified.
Deep EGS represents available geothermal resource not tied to existing hydrothermal sites and at depths below 3.5 km.</p>
<p>Geothermal in ReEDS represents geothermal power production with representative size up to 100 megawatts electric (MW<sub>e</sub>).
Geothermal resource classes are defined by reservoir temperature ranges, which are closely linked to the cost of a plant normalized by generation capacity.
Energy conversion processes, including binary and flash cycles, are linked to reservoir temperature and are specified by resource class.
Plants with reservoir temperatures &lt;200°C (Class 7–10) use a binary cycle, which uses a heat exchanger and secondary working fluid with a lower boiling point to drive a turbine.
All other reservoir temperatures assume a turbine is driven directly by working fluid from the geothermal wells.
These assumptions are aligned with those in the 2024 ATB.</p>

Rather than making all upgrade potential available immediately, upgrade potential is made available over time at the earlier of either the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) license expiration (if applicable) or the turbine age reaching 50 years.
This feature better reflects institutional barriers and industry practices surrounding hydropower facility upgrades.
The total upgrade potential from this methodology is 6.9 GW (27 terawatt-hours [TWh]/yr).</p>

<p>The hydropower operating parameters and constraints included in ReEDS do not fully reflect the complex set of operating constraints on hydropower in the real world.
Detailed site-specific considerations involving a full set of water management challenges are not easily represented in a model with the scale and scope of ReEDS, but several available parameters allow a stylized representation of actual hydropower operating constraints <span id="id72">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2120" title="Brady Stoll, Juan Andrade, Stuart Cohen, Greg Brinkman, and Carlo Brancucci Martinez-Anido.

<p>Each hydropower category can be differentiated into “dispatchable” or “nondispatchable” capacity, with “dispatchable” defined in ReEDS as the ability to provide the following services:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Diurnal load following within the capacity and average daily energy limits for each season</p></li>
<li><p>Planning (adequacy) reserves with full rated capacity</p></li>
<li><p>Operating reserves up to a specified fraction of rated capacity if the capacity is not currently being used for energy production.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Nondispatchable” capacity, on the other hand, provides the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Constant energy output in each season so all available energy is used</p></li>
<li><p>Planning reserves equal to the output power for each season</p></li>
<li><p>No operating reserves.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Dispatchable capacity is also parameterized by a fractional minimum load, with the maximum fractional capacity available for operating reserves as 1 minus the fractional minimum load.
The existing fleet and its corresponding upgrade potential are differentiated by dispatchability using data from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Existing Hydropower Assets Plant Database (<a class="reference external" href="https://hydrosource.ornl.gov/dataset/EHA2023">https://hydrosource.ornl.gov/dataset/EHA2023</a>), which classifies plants by operating mode.
Plants with operating modes labeled as Peaking, Intermediate Peaking, Run-of-River/Upstream Peaking, and Run-of-River/Peaking are classified as dispatchable in ReEDS, and plants with other operating modes are classified as nondispatchable.
In total, 47% of existing capacity and 49% of upgrade potential is assumed nondispatchable.
ReEDS also includes the option to enable hydroposwer upgrade pathways where existing nondispatchable hydropower can be upgraded to be dispatchable hydropower—or existing dispatchable hydropower can be upgraded to add pumping and become a pump-back hydropower facility.
A pump-back facility is constrained similarly to a PSH facility except input energy can come from natural water inflows in addition to the grid.
These upgrade options can be made available at a user-specified capital cost.
Hydropower upgrades are unavailable by default because there is high uncertainty about where such upgrades are feasible, but these optional features allow users to explore the potential and value of increasing hydropower fleet flexibility, which is discussed in detail in <span id="id73">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id606" title="Stuart Cohen and Matthew Mowers.

Lacking minimum capacity data for non-WECC regions, 0.5 is chosen as a reasonable fractional minimum capacity.</p>
<p>Both the NPD and NSD resource assessments implicitly assume inflexible, run-of-river hydropower, so all NPD and NSD resource potential is assumed nondispatchable.
Additional site-specific analysis could allow recategorizing portions of these resources as dispatchable, but 100% nondispatchable remains the default assumption.</p>

<p>ReEDS can generate electricity from biomass either in dedicated biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants or cofired with coal in facilities that have been retrofitted with an auxiliary fuel feed.
These cofire-ready coal plants can use biomass in place of coal to supply the fuel for up to 15% of the plant’s electricity generation.
A cofire retrofit costs $305/kW (in 2017$) based on EIA’s Electricity Market Module assumptions <span id="id75">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id871" title="EIA.

Nationally, approximately 116 million dry tons of woody biomass are assumed to be available to the power sector.
In addition to the supply curve price (which represents the cost of the resource in the field), ReEDS also assumes costs of $15 per dry ton for collection and harvesting as well as an additional $15 per dry ton for transport, based on estimates from a 2014 Idaho National Laboratory study <span id="id78">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1346" title="J.

Pathways with more limited biomass model the impact of a halving of the available resource and a doubling of collection, harvesting, and transport costs (58 million dry tons and $60 per ton), whereas the enhanced resource scenario models the opposite (doubling the available resource to 232 million dry tons and halving collection, harvesting, and transport costs to $15 per ton).</p>

<h3>Fossil and Nuclear Technologies<a class="headerlink" href="#fossil-and-nuclear-technologies" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>ReEDS includes all major categories of fossil (coal, gas, or oil) and nuclear generation technologies within its operating fleet and investment choices.
Coal technologies are subdivided into pulverized and gasified (IGCC) categories, with the pulverized plants further distinguished by whether SO<sub>2</sub> scrubbers are installed and whether their vintage<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref20" id="id81" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>10<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> is pre- or post-1995.
Pulverized coal plants have the option of adding a second fuel feed for biomass (this option is turned off by default).
New coal plants can be added with or without CCS technology.
Existing coal units built after 1995 with SO<sub>2</sub> scrubbers installed also have the option of retrofitting CCS capability.</p>
<p>Natural gas generators are categorized as combustion turbine (CT), combined cycle (CC), or gas-CC with CCS.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref21" id="id82" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>11<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>
The natural gas technologies all use the F-frame turbine cost and performance projections from the ATB, with gas-CC using the 2-on-1 configuration and the gas-CC with CCS using the 95% CCS capture projections.</p>
<p>There are also two types of nuclear (steam) generators: conventional and SMR. The conventional reactors draw their cost and performance from the “large” plants in the ATB and the SMRs from the “small” plants.</p>
<p>Finally, ReEDS includes landfill gas generators<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref22" id="id83" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>12<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> and oil/gas steam generators, although these two technologies are not offered as options for new construction other than those already under construction.
The model distinguishes each fossil and nuclear technology by costs, efficiency, and operational constraints.</p>
<p>Where renewable energy technologies have many unique characteristics, fossil and nuclear technologies are characterized more generally by the following parameters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Capital cost ($/MW)</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed and variable operating costs (dollars per megawatt-hour [$/MWh])</p></li>
<li><p>Fuel costs ($/MMBtu)</p></li>
<li><p>Heat rate (MMBtu/MWh)</p></li>
<li><p>Construction period (years) and expenses</p></li>
<li><p>Equipment lifetime (years)</p></li>
<li><p>Financing costs (such as interest rate, loan period, debt fraction, and debt-service-coverage ratio)</p></li>
<li><p>Tax credits (investment or production)</p></li>
<li><p>Minimum turndown ratio (%)</p></li>
<li><p>Ramp rate (fraction per minute)</p></li>
<li><p>Startup cost ($/MW)</p></li>
<li><p>Scheduled and forced outage rates (%).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cost and performance assumptions for all new fossil and nuclear technologies are taken from the ATB <span id="id84">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1799" title="NREL. 2024 Annual Technology Baseline. Technical Report, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, 2024. URL: https://atb.nrel.gov/.">NREL, 2024</a>]</span> with options for the Conservative, Moderate, and Advanced trajectories from the ATB.
Regional variations and adjustments are included and described in the <a class="reference internal" href="#hydrogen"><span class="xref myst">Hydrogen section</span></a>.
Fixed operation and maintenance costs for coal plants increase over time with the plant’s age. Fixed operation and maintenance costs for nuclear plants increase by a fixed amount after 50 years of being online. These escalation factors are taken from the Annual Energy Outlook 2025 <span id="id85">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id857" title="EIA. Assumptions to the Annual Energy Outlook 2025: electricity market module. Technical Report, Energy Information Administration, Washington, D.C., 2025. URL: https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/assumptions/pdf/EMM_Assumptions.pdf.">EIA, 2025</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>In addition to the performance parameters listed above, technologies are differentiated by their ability to provide operating reserves.
In general, natural gas plants—especially combustion turbines—are better suited for ramping and reserve provision, whereas coal and large-scale nuclear plants are typically designed for steady operation.
See <a class="reference internal" href="#operational-reliability"><span class="xref myst">Operational Reliability</span></a> for more details.</p>
<p>The existing fleet of generators in ReEDS is taken from the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) unit database from AEO2023 <span id="id86">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id855" title="EIA.

In particular, ReEDS uses the net summer capacity, net winter capacity,<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref23" id="id87" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>13<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> location, heat rate, variable O&amp;M (VOM), and FOM to characterize the existing fleet.
ReEDS uses a modified “average” heat rate for any builds occurring after 2010: A technology-specific increase on the full-load heat rate is applied to accommodate units not always operating at their design point.
The modifiers, shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#heat-rate-adjustments"><span class="std std-numref">Table 4</span></a>, are based on the relationship between the reported heat rate in the ATB and the actual observed heat rate, calculated on a fleetwide basis for each fuel type.</p>

<h3>Storage Technologies<a class="headerlink" href="#storage-technologies" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>ReEDS includes PSH and utility-scale batteries as diurnal storage options and hydrogen (discussed in the <a class="reference internal" href="#hydrogen"><span class="xref myst">Hydrogen</span></a> section) as seasonal storage.
All storage options are capable of load shifting (arbitrage), providing planning and operating reserves, and reducing curtailment of variable renewable energy (VRE).
Generally, load shifting is accomplished by charging the storage or reservoir during inexpensive, low-demand time steps and discharging at peak times.
Although storage is neither directly linked nor assumed to be co-located with renewable energy technologies in ReEDS (except in the case of PV-storage hybrids; see <a class="reference internal" href="#pv-battery-hybrids-pvb"><span class="xref myst">PV + battery hybrids (PVB)</span></a>), it can play an important role in reducing curtailed electricity from variable generation resources by charging during time steps with excess renewable generation.
The ability of storage to reduce curtailment is calculated endogenously.
We apply a minimum VOM of $0.01/MWh (in 2004$) to all storage to avoid degeneracy with renewable energy curtailment.</p>
<p>The nameplate capacity of storage can contribute toward planning reserves, although at a potentially reduced rate based on either its capacity credit or its energy availability during stress periods.
The contribution of storage toward the reserve margin requirement is discussed further in <a class="reference internal" href="#resource-adequacy"><span class="xref myst">Resource Adequacy</span></a>.
Capacity not being used for charging or discharging can also be used to provide any of the operating reserves products represented in ReEDS (see <a class="reference internal" href="#electricity-system-operation-and-reliability"><span class="xref myst">Electricity System Operation and Reliability</span></a> on how reserves are differentiated in ReEDS).
An energy penalty is associated with storage to provide regulation reserves that reflect losses because of charging and discharging.
Storage is also required to have sufficient charge to provide operating reserves in addition to any charge already required for generation in the appropriate time step.</p>
<p>Storage in ReEDS is represented using both a fixed energy-to-power capacity ratio—such as pumped hydro, which is characterized by the number of hours (duration) the storage can discharge at its rated power capacity—and a flexible energy-to-power capacity ratio, which is used for batteries, where the rated power and energy capacities can be sized independently—making the duration an output rather than an input.
Storage can be selected using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_Storage</span></code>. The model can also represent long-duration energy storage (LDES), although accurate modeling requires selecting a temporal resolution that supports interperiod linkage. This can be achieved either by choosing hourly resolution with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_HourlyType</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">year</span></code> or by using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_HourlyType</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">day</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wek</span></code> with interday linkage enabled.</p>
<div class="admonition-storage-options admonition">

<p>Utility-scale batteries are not restricted by location-specific resource constraints.
Existing battery capacity is represented in the model based on the input plant database (see <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inputs/capacity_exogenous/ReEDS_generator_database_final_EIA-NEMS.csv</span></code>).
Battery cost and performance assumptions are based on lithium-ion battery systems, originally sourced from the ATB <span id="id92">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1800" title="NREL. Annual Technology Baseline. 2024. URL: https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2024/data.">NREL, 2024</a>]</span>.
Low, mid, and high cost projections are available.
Battery cost scenario is set by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plantchar_battery</span></code>.
The capital cost of a battery comprises two components: the overnight power unit cost (in $/kW), which reflects the cost associated with the battery’s maximum power output, and the overnight energy unit cost (in $/kWh), which represents the cost associated with its maximum energy storage capacity—allowing the model to independently size power and energy capacities based on the respective unit costs.
FOM costs of the battery are divided into two components as well: a 2.5% per year power FOM based on the power-related capital cost and a 2.5% per year energy FOM based on the energy-related capital cost.
In contrast to all other generator technologies in ReEDS that have lifetimes that meet or exceed typical model evaluation windows for book life, the battery is assumed to last 15 years.
As a result, its capital cost is uprated by the ratio of a 15-year evaluation window and the evaluation window used by the run.
The batteries are assumed to have a round-trip efficiency of 85%. Battery storage has a representative size of 60 MW.</p>
<p>Existing PSH capacity is represented in the model according to the input plant database (see <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inputs/capacity_exogenous/ReEDS_generator_database_final_EIA-NEMS.csv</span></code>).
New PSH potential is derived from a national PSH resource assessment described in <span id="id93">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1974" title="Evan Rosenlieb, Donna Heimiller, and Stuart Cohen.

<h3>Hydrogen<a class="headerlink" href="#hydrogen" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>ReEDS models the use of hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), both as a form of seasonal storage to meet power system requirements and as a clean fuel produced by the power sector for use in other sectors.</p>
<p>In the power sector, hydrogen can be consumed as a fuel in hydrogen combustion turbines (H<sub>2</sub>-CTs) and hydrogen combined cycles (H<sub>2</sub>-CCs).

<p>Power sector hydrogen use is determined by the model’s optimization; as with natural gas plants and other fuel-based generators, ReEDS weighs the costs of investment in H<sub>2</sub>-CTs and procuring hydrogen against other options for serving load and meeting other power system constraints. In contrast, demand for hydrogen produced by the power sector but used externally in other sectors is specifically exogenously as an input. This demand is intended to capture hydrogen used in sector such as transportation or industry and can be specified in terms of a total national hydrogen by year.</p>
<p>The model includes a range of options for representing the production, transport, and storage of hydrogen as well as the spatial resolution at which hydrogen demand is serviced.
These options include 1) as a drop-in renewable fuel with a fixed price,
2) endogenous representation of production with national balancing, and
3) endogenous representation of production with zonal balancing.
Each of these representations is discussed in more detail below.
By default, the model uses the third option (endogenous representation with zonal balancing), with the interzonal transportation option turned off.</p>

Because this is the only hydrogen cost modeled with this approach, this fuel cost represents an “all-in” cost that includes the cost of production, delivery, and storage of hydrogen.
Users can specify different trajectories for fuel costs over time.</p>
<p>Under the drop-in renewable fuel approach, the use of curtailed renewable energy for H<sub>2</sub>-CT fuel production is not explicitly considered; to capture this dynamic, the production of hydrogen must be endogenously modeled in ReEDS, which is described in the next section.</p>

<p>Under this representation of hydrogen, ReEDS ensures sufficient hydrogen production to match total annual demand at a national level.
This means hydrogen demand from H<sub>2</sub>-CTs and external sources is represented on an annual basis and hydrogen can be produced in any location or time period in the model to serve that demand.
Users can apply an adder to the production of hydrogen to represent additional costs of transporting and storing hydrogen (a nonzero cost is included by default), but these options are not explicitly represented in this formulation.</p>
</section>

<h4>Endogenous production with zonal balancing, transport, and storage<a class="headerlink" href="#endogenous-production-with-zonal-balancing-transport-and-storage" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>In this approach, hydrogen production is explicitly represented; however, instead of matching hydrogen supply and demand at the national level, they are matched in each model zone.
The equation below reflects how, for each region <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> in each time period <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span>, the model balances hydrogen supply, which includes production (Prod), storage withdrawals (StorOut), and transfers from neighboring regions <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(rr\)</span> (Flow), with hydrogen demand, including storage injections (StorIn), transfers to neighboring regions, and demand from H<sub>2</sub>-CTs and other sectors.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\text{Prod}_{h,r} + \text{StorOut}_{h,r} + \sum_{rr} \text{Flow}_{h,rr,r}
= \text{StorIn}_{h,r} + \sum_{rr} \text{Flow}_{h,rr,r} + \text{H}_2\text{CT}_{h,r} + \text{Exog}_{h,r}\]</div>
<p>Hydrogen demand from the power sector is attributed to a given zone based on H<sub>2</sub>-CT usage within that zone, whereas exogenous hydrogen demand is allocated to zones using regional demand fractions.
These regional demand fractions are calculated based on values from <span id="id105">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1982" title="Mark Ruth, Paige Jadun, Elizabeth Connelly, Richard Boardman, A. J. Simon, Amgad Elgowainy, Jarett Zuboy, and Nicholas Gilroy. H2&#64;Scale Hydrogen Economic Potential Supply and Demand Locations.

The 2021 regional demand fractions are based on the reference scenario and exclude demands for light-duty vehicles, biofuels, and methanol.
The 2050 regional demand fractions are based on the low-cost electrolysis scenario and include all demands from the dataset.</p>
<p>To store hydrogen, a zone must invest in storage capacity.
ReEDS currently represents two forms of geological hydrogen storage—either in salt caverns or hard rock formations—as well as the ability to construct storage in underground pipe systems.
Data on the availability of geological storage are taken from <span id="id106">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1539" title="Anna S. Lord, Peter H. Kobos, and David J. Borns. Geologic storage of hydrogen: Scaling up to meet city transportation demands. International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 39(28):15570–15582, September 2014.

Because of the lack of credible estimates on available reservoir capacity, ReEDS does not impose limits on the amount of storage that a zone connected to a reservoir can build.
However, to ensure hydrogen combustion turbine dispatch is correctly represented during stress periods, the minimum storage duration is set to 24 hours.</p>

For geological storage, ReEDS assumes $/kg based on the economies of scale from constructing two to three caverns.
To reduce model complexity, ReEDS assumes each zone can build only the cheapest storage option it has available.
At least 1% of the region’s land area must overlap with the storage availability estimates from <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-hydrogen-storage-availability"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 34</span></a> for that storage type to be an option in that region.
ReEDS requires any hydrogen storage be sized to hold at least 24 hours’ worth of hydrogen to run the H<sub>2</sub>-CTs in a given region.
This minimum duration helps ensure the representative year has the storage needed to serve stress periods outside of the representative year.</p>
<p>ReEDS also allows the modeling of interzonal hydrogen transport.
Transport requires the construction of hydrogen pipelines, and the model assumes cost estimates based on the H<sub>2</sub> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/sera-model.html">SERA model</a>.
Modeling hydrogen transport in ReEDS is an experimental feature and, because this feature adds significant runtime, the model includes the option to model zonal balancing with transport disabled or a fixed $/kg hydrogen transport cost.</p>

<h3>Direct Air Capture<a class="headerlink" href="#direct-air-capture" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The model can also procure negative emissions by removing and storing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere using direct air capture.
DAC in the ReEDS model is represented as a sorbent design that uses only electricity as an input, with an energy consumption of 3.72 MWh per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> removed.
Overnight capital costs are assumed to be $1,932 per tonne-year capture capacity, with annual FOM costs of 4.6% of the capital costs and nonfuel VOM costs of $21 per tonne.</p>

<section id="co2-transport-and-storage">
<h3>CO<sub>2</sub> Transport and Storage<a class="headerlink" href="#co2-transport-and-storage" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>ReEDS has the option to use a detailed CO<sub>2</sub> network representation that, when turned on, requires all CO<sub>2</sub> captured at CCS facilities (generation-based CCS, steam methane reforming with CCS, and DAC) to be transported via liquid CO<sub>2</sub> pipelines and sequestered in underground saline aquifers.
“Trunk” pipelines can be built between zonal transmission endpoints, and “spur” pipelines can be built from zonal transmission endpoints to the edge of any nearby (&lt;200 mi) aquifer.
These pipelines can be assigned different capital and FOM costs, and the several hundred saline aquifers identified by the National Energy Technology Laboratory have $/tonne breakeven costs that represent the cost of sequestering CO<sub>2</sub> in the aquifer (i.e., permitting, injection facilities, monitoring, and a 100-year trust fund for maintenance).</p>
<p>The network representation includes only saline aquifers with a reservoir cost of &lt;$20/tonne at a 90% capacity factor.

<p>The binning structure is designed flexibly so users can choose the appropriate levels of model fidelity and computational speed for each application.
Historical units are binned using a k-means clustering algorithm for each zone and technology category (e.g., coal with or without SO<sub>2</sub> scrubbers; natural gas combined cycle) combination.
The user specifies a maximum number of bins and a minimum deviation across unit heat rates.
Any two plants are eligible to form separate bins if the difference between their heat rates is greater than the minimum deviation parameter.
The number of bins formed is then equal to the smaller of the maximum bin number parameter and the number of units after applying the minimum deviation criteria.
For each bin, the assigned heat rate is equal to the capacity-weighted average of the heat rates for the units inside the bin.</p>
<!--
TODO: This figure is out of date; the x axis is "Ventyx heat rate" but we don't use Ventyx for the unit database anymore.

An illustrative example of the results is depicted for two zones in {numref}`figure-capacity-binning-example`, assuming a maximum of seven bins and minimum deviation of 50 BTU per kWh.
The horizontal axis corresponds to the heat rate for a given power plant unit from the NEMS database, while the vertical axis corresponds to the heat rate each bin is assigned in ReEDS.
Points on the 45° line illustrate units for which the ReEDS heat rate is the same as the NEMS heat rate.
The more tightly clustered the points are around this line, the less the model will suffer from aggregation bias.
The figure illustrates that, in general, the fewer the number of units in a given technology category (in this example, nuclear and scrubbed coal), the closer the binned heat rates are to the actual heat rates.
The aggregation is set by "numhintage" in cases.csv, and is set to 6 by default.

Once a generator has reached its lifetime, it is retired.
Renewable energy and battery lifetime assumptions are shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#technology-lifetimes"><span class="std std-numref">Table 7</span></a>.
When renewable energy capacity is retired, the resource associated with that capacity is made available, and ReEDS can choose to rebuild a renewable energy generator using the newly available resource without the need to rebuild the grid interconnection infrastructure.
A consequence of this assumption is retired renewable capacity can be replaced without incurring interconnection costs and, with all other considerations being equal, repowered or rebuilt renewable capacity has lower costs than new “greenfield” capacity of the same type.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref31" id="id113" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>19<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>

<p>Retirement of existing fossil and nuclear capacity in ReEDS is primarily a function of announced retirement dates and technology-specific estimated lifetimes, taken from the AEO2023 NEMS plant database and EIA 860M.
Retirement dates of coal plants are further checked and updated in case the EIA 860M does not capture the latest retirement dates.
Retirement dates for several nuclear plants, which are not current in NEMS and EIA 860M, are manually updated (Diablo nuclear power plants in California and Palisades nuclear power plant in Michigan).
Both existing and economically built generators have the lifetimes shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#technology-lifetimes"><span class="std std-numref">Table 7</span></a>.
These lifetimes are used as necessary when the solution period extends beyond 2050.</p>
<p>In addition to age-based retirements, ReEDS includes the option to endogenously retire technologies (this option is turned on by default).
When doing endogenous retirements, ReEDS is trading off the value provided to the system by the plant versus the costs incurred by keeping the plant online.
If the value is not sufficient to recover the costs, ReEDS will choose to retire the plant.
ReEDS includes a “retirement friction” parameter that allows a plant to stay online as long as it is recovering at least a portion of its fixed operating costs.
For example, if this retirement friction parameter is set to 0.5, a plant will retire only if it does not recover at least half of its fixed costs.
In addition, ReEDS includes a minimum retirement age for existing fossil and nuclear plants of 20 years, meaning a fossil or nuclear plant is not allowed to be endogenously retired until it is at least 20 years old.</p>

<section id="growth-constraints">
<h4>Growth constraints<a class="headerlink" href="#growth-constraints" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>The ReEDS model can represent either absolute growth constraints (e.g., wind builds cannot exceed 100 GW per year) or relative growth constraints (e.g., wind capacity cannot grow by more than 50% per year).
The growth constraints are designed to target a broader technology group as opposed to the individual classes of wind, PV, and CSP; as an example, the growth constraint would restrict the builds of all wind technologies and classes and not just a specific class.
The default values for the absolute growth constraints are the highest year-over-year changes of each technology type’s capacity from 2010 to 2020.
For CSP, the default absolute growth limit is assigned the same as PV, because it has not seen the capacity buildout as PV or wind has as of 2020.
The relative growth limits are applied on a state level and are based on historical compounded annual growth rate estimates observed for solar PV from 2012 to 2022.
The penalties are assessed in ReEDS based on the maximum previous growth observed in the model.
For example, if a state experienced 1,000 MW of new capacity in 2024 and 500 MW of new capacity in 2025, the growth penalty would be applied using the 1,000-MW value even though it is older.</p>

<p>Natural gas fuel prices are adjusted by the model as explained below.</p>
<p>Coal and uranium are assumed to be perfectly inelastic; the price is predetermined and insensitive to the ReEDS demand for the fuel.
With natural gas, however, the price and demand are linked.
Actual natural gas prices in ReEDS are based on the AEO scenario prices but are not exactly the same; instead, they are price-responsive to ReEDS natural gas demand.
In each year, each census division is characterized by a price-demand “setpoint” taken from the AEO Reference scenario but also by two elasticity coefficients: regional (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_r\)</span>) and national (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_{\text{nat}}\)</span>) elasticity coefficients for the rate of regional price change with respect to 1) the change in the regional gas demand from its setpoint and 2) the overall change in the national gas demand from the national price-demand setpoint, respectively.

<section id="electricity-demand">
<h2>Electricity Demand<a class="headerlink" href="#electricity-demand" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>End-use electricity demand is an exogenous input to ReEDS represented by hourly profiles.
The available load profile options fall into three categories: 1) load projections from Evolved Energy Research, 2) load projections developed as part of the Electrification Futures Study and 3) historic load multiplied by annual load growth factors from AEO.
When applicable, ReEDS will modify the exogenously specified profiles by applying a load shape adjustment method that incorporates analysis from other modeling tools or by adding load from endogenously built electricity-consuming technologies.</p>
<p>ReEDS includes interzonal transmission system losses in the optimization but does not represent distribution losses.
To account for this, the end-use load must be scaled up by a distribution loss factor to convert it to busbar load.
A distribution loss factor of 5%, which is estimated based on a combination of EIA and ReEDS numbers, is used for this conversion.
Note that distribution losses do not apply to rooftop PV generation because this generation is assumed to be used locally within the distribution network.
ReEDS is required to generate sufficient power to meet busbar load (allowing for transmission of power but accounting for losses) in each hour and zone.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref37" id="id145" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>21<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

<p>The load profiles from Evolved Energy Research (EER) are the newest load profile addition to the model.
EER builds hourly, state-level load profiles for each end-use sector, disaggregates them to the ReEDS zone level, and then aggregates them across sectors to produce the total end-use load profiles used in ReEDS.
The profiles feature 15 weather years of data (2007–2013 and 2016–2023), allowing us to compute resource adequacy based on a wide variety of weather conditions.
There are three sets of EER profiles, each reflecting different electrification assumptions: EER_Baseline_AEO2023, EER_IRAlow, and EER_100by2050.
EER_Baseline_AEO2023 reflects business-as-usual electrification based on load estimates from AEO2023.
EER_IRAlow reflects the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which features many tax credits and subsidies for electric end-use technologies such as electric vehicles and heat pumps.
Specifically, EER_IRAlow “reflects relatively conservative assumptions about the impact of demand-side provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (relative, compared to other scenarios developed by EER)” <span id="id146">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1077" title="Pieter Gagnon, An Pham, Wesley Cole, Sarah Awara, Anne Barlas, Maxwell Brown, Patrick Brown, Vincent Carag, Stuart Cohen, Anne Hamilton, Jonathan Ho, Sarah Inskeep, Akash Karmakar, Luke Lavin, Anthony Lopez, Trieu Mai, Joseph Mowers, Matthew Mowers, Caitlin Murphy, Paul Pinchuk, Anna Schleifer, Brian Sergi, Daniel Steinberg, and Travis Williams. 2023 Standard Scenarios Report: A U.S. Electricity Sector Outlook.

<h3>Electrification Futures Study Load Profiles<a class="headerlink" href="#electrification-futures-study-load-profiles" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>ReEDS also contains detailed electrification load profiles developed as part of the Electrification Futures Study using EnergyPATHWAYS <span id="id147">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2135" title="Yinong Sun, Paige Jadun, Brent Nelson, Matteo Muratori, Caitlin Murphy, Jeffrey Logan, and Trieu Mai.

The profiles use one weather year of data (2012).
Because there is only a single weather year, the model duplicates these profiles to match the number of weather years specified by the user.
Note that this results in loss of synchronicity between demand and other weather-based data when weather years beyond 2012 are selected.
There are five sets of profiles, each reflecting different electrification assumptions: EPREFERENCE, EPMEDIUM, EPMEDIUMStretch2040, EPMEDIUMStretch2046, and EPHIGH.
EPREFERENCE serves as a baseline of comparison to the other scenarios, featuring the least incremental change in electrification through 2050.
EPMEDIUM features widespread electrification among the “low-hanging fruit” opportunities in electric vehicles, heat pumps, and select industrial applications.
EPMEDIUMStretch2040 and EPMEDIUMStretch2046 are modified versions of EPMEDIUM that lower the aggressiveness of its electrification assumptions by “stretching” its load growth through 2040 and 2046 respectively out to 2050 such that total 2040 and 2046 load from EPMEDIUM are equivalent to 2050 load from EPMEDIUMStretch2040 and EPMEDIUMStretch2046 respectively.
EPHIGH features a combination of technology advancements, policy support, and consumer enthusiasm that enables transformational change in electrification.

<h3>Historical Load Data + AEO Growth Factor Profiles<a class="headerlink" href="#historical-load-data-aeo-growth-factor-profiles" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Load can also be modeled in ReEDS with historical hourly profiles multiplied by load growth factors from AEO.
The historical profiles feature 15 weather years of data (2007–2013 and 2016–2023), with the pre-2014 and post-2015 profiles created using distinct methodologies, which are described below.</p>
<p>For 2007–2013, historic hourly load data are collected for each year at the utility region level from FERC Form 714 and the RTO/independent system operator (ISO) region level from RTO/ISO websites.
Interannual load growth is removed from these profiles using regional load growth factors.
Specifically, the profiles for years outside of 2012 are “ungrown” such that their annual regional totals approximately match those of the 2012 profiles.
The ungrown profiles are then converted to the ReEDS zone level.
This is done by first determining the buses that exist in each region and allocating each region’s load to its buses using bus-level load participation factors from Energy Visuals.
The buses are then mapped to ReEDS zones, based strictly on bus location and ReEDS zone boundaries, and the bus-level load is re-aggregated to the ReEDS zone level.
Using retail energy load data from EIA’s Electricity Data Browser <span id="id148">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id875" title="EIA. Electric Power Detailed State Data. 2015. URL: http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/ (visited on 2015-06-29).">EIA, 2015</a>]</span>, the zonal load profiles for each year are then scaled such that the annual total load of the zones comprising a given state roughly matches that state’s total 2010 retail sales of electricity.</p>
<p>For 2016–2023, historic hourly load data are collected for each year at the NERC balancing authority region and subregion level from EIA Form 930 and RTO/ISO websites.
The profiles are then downscaled to the county level and re-aggregated to the ReEDS zone level.</p>
<p>The historic load profiles are combined to create a full 15-year dataset, and a method developed by Evolved Energy Research is applied to the dataset to remove interannual load growth.
Specifically, for each zone, a linear regression model is fitted to the 2016–2023 subset of the zone’s load profile, with time as the predictor variable and load as the response variable, and then the regression model is used to generate a predicted load value at each hour, the full set of which represents the trend of the profile.
The load profile is then “detrended” by subtracting the trend from it (i.e., subtracting the predicted load value at each hour from the actual load value at that hour) and then rescaled to roughly match 2023 load by adding to each hourly load value the last value of the trend (i.e., the predicted load value associated with the final hour of 2023).
For each zone and weather year from 2007 to 2013, that year’s subset of the zone’s load profile is scaled such that total annual load matches the average annual load of the detrended 2016–2023 data.</p>
<p>State-level load growth factors for 2010–2050 are obtained from AEO for each of their electricity consumption scenarios - low, reference, and high.
For each zone and model year in ReEDS, the zone’s load profile is scaled according to the growth factor of the zone’s state for that year, with the load profile’s shape remaining constant throughout the study period.</p>

<h3>Load Adjustment Method for End-Use Profiles<a class="headerlink" href="#load-adjustment-method-for-end-use-profiles" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>ReEDS includes a methodology to incorporate changes to hourly electric load shapes derived from analysis of other modeling tools.
Regional hourly load changes are paired with a defined regional adoption trajectory for this load change by year.
Combining these two factors allows ReEDS to change to load profiles specific to region, year, and hour.
A further unique capability of this method is that an arbitrary number of load changes and adoption trajectories can be provided, allowing sophisticated changes to load shapes with a small number of provided parameters.</p>

<section id="endogenous-load">
<h3>Endogenous Load<a class="headerlink" href="#endogenous-load" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>ReEDS models a few electricity-consuming technologies that, when built and operated in the model, can endogenously increase the load profile in addition to the exogenously specified profiles discussed above.
Those electricity-consuming technologies are electrolyzers, steam methane reforming with or without CCS, and DAC.
These technologies are assumed to consume electricity at the wholesale electricity price.
ReEDS users can alter this assumption with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_RetailAdder</span></code> switch, which adds a 2004$/MWh cost adder to electricity consumed by these technologies.</p>

<section id="transmission">
<h2>Transmission<a class="headerlink" href="#transmission" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>ReEDS considers two categories of transmission: “local interconnection” of generation capacity within the model zones and “interzonal” or “long-distance” transmission between the model zones.
These two categories of transmission share underlying cost data but are represented differently within the model.
Transmission costs are described first, followed by the separate representations of “local interconnection” and “interzonal” (or “long-distance”) transmission within ReEDS.</p>
<section id="transmission-costs">
<h3>Transmission Costs<a class="headerlink" href="#transmission-costs" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Estimated costs for transmission lines are generated by defining a high-geographic-resolution cost surface, then using a least-cost-path algorithm to identify a representative transmission line path between two points <span id="id149">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1535" title="Anthony Lopez, Gabriel Zuckerman, Pavlo Pinchuk, Michael Gleason, Marie Rivers, Sophie-Min Thomson, Donna Heimiller, Owen Roberts, Travis Williams, Wesley Cole, and Trieu Mai.

The final $/MW cost for a particular route is then given by the integrated $/MW-mile values for the cost surface points traversed by the least-cost route.</p>
<p>Base voltage-dependent $/MW-mile transmission costs are taken from four sources:
Southern California Edison for California Independent System Operator (CAISO) and the Northeast,
Western Electricity Coordinating Council/Transmission Expansion Planning Policy Committee (WECC/TEPPC) for non-CAISO areas in the Western Interconnection,
Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) for the Midwest, and a representative utility for the Southeast.
These base transmission costs are shown on the left side of <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-transmission-cost-input-data"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 44</span></a>.
Cost multipliers based on terrain type (hilly, with land slope between 2% and 8%, and mountainous, with ≥8% land slope) and land class (pasture/farmland, wetland, suburban, urban, and forest) are taken from the same four sources.
A separate 90-m-resolution CONUS dataset of terrain and land classes is then combined with the base transmission costs, terrain multipliers, and land class multipliers to generate the cost surface used in the least-cost-path routing algorithm.</p>

<h4>Spur lines and substation upgrades<a class="headerlink" href="#spur-lines-and-substation-upgrades" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Spur lines represent short-distance transmission built to connect new wind and solar generation capacity to a “point of interconnection” on the existing transmission system.
For a given wind/solar site (the ~50,000 reV supply curve points discussed above), existing substations and high-voltage transmission lines (taken from <span id="id152">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1238" title="Homeland Infrastructure Foundation Level Database (HIFLD).

Least-cost paths are calculated to all candidate POIs (assuming 138 kV for all spur lines), and the POI with the lowest resulting path-dependent spur line cost is taken as the POI for that wind/solar site.
Substation POIs incur a substation upgrade cost of $15/kW; transmission line POIs incur a new-substation cost of $35/kW.</p>

<section id="network-reinforcement">
<h4>Network reinforcement<a class="headerlink" href="#network-reinforcement" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Network reinforcement represents upgrades to the existing transmission network required to avoid congestion when moving power from the POI for a new generator to load centers.
It is intended to represent the costs associated with interconnection queues, which represent a major bottleneck for the deployment of new wind and solar in the United States. <span id="id153">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1127" title="Will Gorman, Julie Mulvaney Kemp, Joseph Rand, Joachim Seel, Ryan Wiser, Nick Manderlink, Fredrich Kahrl, Kevin Porter, and Will Cotton.

Network reinforcement costs are approximated by tracing a path along existing transmission lines from each wind/solar POI to each zone “center” within the same state;
the zone center is usually taken as the largest population center in the model zone but is sometimes (for zones without large urban centers) assigned to a high-voltage substation within the zone.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref35" id="id154" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>22<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>
A cost for each reinforcement route is calculated using the cost surface described in <a class="reference internal" href="#transmission-costs"><span class="xref myst">Transmission costs</span></a>, with capital expenditure (CAPEX) costs multiplied by 50% to approximate the lower cost for reconductoring compared to greenfield transmission construction.
The single lowest-cost route for each POI is then selected; the associated reinforcement cost [$/MW] and transmission distance [MW-miles] are incurred for every MW of new wind/solar capacity added at all reV sites associated with that POI.
(This heuristic method of tracing a path from the POI to the largest load center in the zone is highly simplified and does not represent all the considerations involved in an actual interconnection study.)</p>

<section id="interzonal-transmission">
<h3>Interzonal Transmission<a class="headerlink" href="#interzonal-transmission" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Interzonal transmission flows in ReEDS are modeled using a simple energy balance and transport model (sometimes called a “pipe and bubble” or “pipe flow” approach) between model zones,
with each zone treated as a “copper plate” (i.e., without monitoring flows or enforcing flow limits within zones).
Within each zone, electricity generation and imports, minus interzonal demand and exports, must sum to zero;
interzonal flows are constrained by the MW capacity of each interzonal interface (which can be expanded, as discussed below).</p>
<p>Four types of interzonal transmission are considered in ReEDS:
alternating current (AC), representing the large majority of existing U.S. capacity;
point-to-point high-voltage direct current (HVDC) with line commutated converters (LCC);
meshed multiterminal HVDC with voltage source converters (VSC);
and back-to-back (B2B) AC/DC/AC converters.</p>
<p>Existing AC interface capacities are calculated using a nodal DC power flow model, but within the ReEDS linear optimization, the balance of flows between interfaces is not constrained by optimal power flow.</p>
<p>The representation of existing interzonal transmission capacity is discussed first, followed by the representation of new interzonal transmission capacity additions.</p>

For each interzonal interface (where an interface is defined as the collection of transmission lines that cross between a pair of model zones),
a linear optimization is performed to determine the collection of transmission line flows and nodal injections and withdrawals that maximize the power flow across the interface,
subject to constraints on individual line ratings,
the relationship between nodal injections/withdrawals and line flows as governed by the power transfer distribution factor matrix,
nodal load distributions as determined by fixed load participation factors,
and a requirement that generation buses can only inject power to the network and load buses can only withdraw power from the network.
Published WECC path limits are also applied as constraints on the combined line flow for the lines that comprise each path <span id="id159">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2280" title="Western Electricity Coordinating Council. 2022 Path Rating Catalog - Public Version.

that is, every transmission line between a pair of regions cannot in general be used at their rated capacities at the same time.
The same effect is observed for larger interfaces;
when modeled at nodal resolution,
the maximum flow between SPP and MISO (for example) is smaller than the sum of the zonal ITLs for the zonal interfaces that span the larger SPP-MISO interface.

<p>For the planning region ITLs, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n - 1\)</span> contingency considerations are approximated by dropping the interregional line that contributes the most capacity to the calculated ITL for each interregional interface and flow direction, then recalculating the ITL with that line removed.
ITLs between model zones are calulcated under <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n - 0\)</span> conditions—i.e., without accounting for contingency events.
Because the ITLs are applied simultaneously for all interfaces during the ReEDS optimization,
applying <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n - 1\)</span> ratings for every interzonal interface (of which there are nearly 300) would imply an unrealistically large number of simultaneous outages on the largest-capacity lines.</p>
<p>To reflect the idea that interregional planning focuses more on higher-voltage (&gt;230-kV) lines than lower-voltage lines,
an extra filtering step is applied when calculating the starting interface capacities.
For each interface, if &lt;50% of the interface capacity derives from &lt;230 kV lines,
&lt;230 kV lines are dropped from the total interface capacity;
if ≥50% of the capacity comes from &lt;230-kV lines, all lines are kept.
This filter is always applied for ITLs between the planning subregions;
i.e., only &gt;230-kV lines are included in the calculated ITL between planning subregions.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#kv" id="id161" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>23<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

<p>The cost of new interzonal transmission capacity between each pair of model zones is calculated in the reV model using the base costs shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-transmission-cost-input-data"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 44</span></a>.
For each pair of zones, a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NREL/reVX/tree/main/reVX/least_cost_xmission">least-cost path</a> between the two zone “centers” (the same “centers” described in <a class="reference internal" href="#network-reinforcement"><span class="xref myst">Network reinforcement</span></a>) is determined.
(Example paths from Maine to each of the other ReEDS zones are shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-lcp-p134"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 49</span></a>.)
The integrated $/mile cost along the least-cost path determines the $/MW cost for expanding the interface capacity between the linked zones;
the length of the least-cost path determines the distance (used in the calculation of transmission losses within the model,
and of the total TW-miles of transmission capacity calculated in postprocessing).</p>

Interfaces crossing between the three asynchronous interconnections that are currently linked by B2B capacity can also be expanded endogenously.
B2B connections are modeled as AC lines on either side of an AC/DC/AC converter, so the per-mile costs and distances use AC values.

two levels of flow constraints are applied: one at the model zone level and one at the planning subregion level, with existing AC capacity between planning subregions assessed at the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n - 1\)</span> contingency level.
As an approximation of contingency considerations for new transmission capacity (which cannot be assessed directly because interzonal transmission capacity, like all other variables in ReEDS, is represented linearly rather than as individual units or transmission lines),
the contribution of new interzonal AC transmission capacity to flow limits between planning subregions is derated by 15%.
That is, between a pair of zones that span a planning subregion interface,
100 MW of new interzonal transmission investment increases the flow limit between those two zones by 100 MW
but increases the flow limit between the containing planning subregions only by 85 MW.

<p>Within ReEDS, point-to-point HVDC is represented as part of the AC network, with a converter on either side of the interface;
1 MW of HVDC line capacity is accompanied by 2 MW of converters (1 MW on either side of the interface).
If multiple point-to-point HVDC links are added in series—for example, to move power from Zone A to Zone C through an intermediate zone B—AC/DC conversion losses are incurred in each zone.
In this three-zone example, adding 1 MW of capacity from Zone A to Zone C would entail adding 1 MW of line capacity to the A-B and B-C interfaces, 1 MW of AC/DC converter capacity in each of Zones A and C, and 2 MW of converter capacity in Zone B.</p>
<p>In the multiterminal HVDC representation, the capacities of HVDC links and AC/DC converters are independently optimized, and the HVDC network is modeled
as an “overlay” on top of the AC network, with AC/DC converter capacity linking the two networks.
In the three-zone example described in the previous paragraph, adding 1 MW of capacity from Zone A to Zone C under the multiterminal framework would not require any converter capacity to be added in Zone B.</p>
<p>Multiterminal HVDC is turned off by default.
Existing HVDC connections (all of which use LCC at the time of this writing) are allowed to be endogenously expanded starting in the same year that new AC capacity additions are allowed.</p>

<p>All ancillary reserve requirements must be satisfied in each zone for each time slice;
however, reserve provision can be traded between zones using AC transmission corridors.
Trades are allowed only within planning regions (<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-hierarchy"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 17</span></a>) and not across planning region boundaries.
The amount of reserves that can be traded is limited by the amount of carrying capacity of an AC transmission corridor that is not already being used for trading energy.</p>
<p>The ability of technologies to contribute to reserves is limited by the ramping requirement for a given reserve product, the plant ramp rate, and online capacity (<code class="xref std std-numref docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">generation-techs-flexability-params</span></code>).
Online capacity is approximated in ReEDS as the maximum generation from all time slices within a modeled day.
Reserves can be provided by generation and storage technologies that are turned on but not fully dispatched in a time slice.
In addition, demand-side interruptible load can also contribute to reserve requirements, if enabled in a scenario.
PV and wind are not allowed to contribute toward the supply of reserves.</p>
<p>The cost for providing regulation reserves is represented in ReEDS using data from <span id="id174">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1287" title="Marissa Hummon, Paul Denholm, Jennie Jorgenson, David Palchak, Brendan Kirby, and Ookie Ma.

Because ReEDS does not clearly distinguish between coal fuel types, $12.5/MWh is the assumed regulation cost for all coal technologies.
The cost of providing regulation reserves from gas-CT, geothermal, biopower, and landfill gas is assumed to be the same as oil/gas steam.</p>

<h3>“Stress Periods” RA Method<a class="headerlink" href="#stress-periods-ra-method" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The stress periods method is described in detail by <span id="id181">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1585" title="Trieu Mai, Patrick R Brown, Luke Lavin, Surya Dhulipala, and Jessica Kuna. Incorporating stressful grid conditions for reliable and cost-effective electricity system planning. 2024.

Within the ReEDS optimization, stress periods are modeled in the same manner as <a class="reference internal" href="#representative-periods"><span class="xref myst">representative periods</span></a>
(using the same sets of variables and constraints for storage operations, transmission flows, and VRE availability, for example),
with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Electricity demand during stress periods is scaled up by the <a class="reference internal" href="#planning-reserve-margins"><span class="xref myst">planning reserve margin</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The “weight” of stress periods (used in the calculation of operational costs including fuel costs, VOM costs, etc.) is set to 6 hours in total per year.
Representative periods, in contrast, are weighted at 8760 hours per year (for an average of 365.25 days per year, accounting for leap years).
This approach—with a low but nonzero weight during stress periods—provides realistic dispatch profiles during stress periods but ensures reported operational costs are dominated by the representative periods, which are selected to minimize regional errors in electricity demand and capacity factor associated with time series aggregation.</p></li>
<li><p>Hydrogen fuel is assumed to be always available during stress periods;
stress periods are not part of the interday accounting of hydrogen storage levels shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-temporal-h2"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 22</span></a>, and endogenous electricity demand from electolyzers, steam methane reforming, and DAC is assumed to be zero during stress periods.</p></li>
<li><p>Diurnal storage (batteries and pumped hydro) is modeled continuously over chronologically consecutive stress periods;
for example, if both 2008-02-27 and 2008-02-28 are stress periods, the last hour of 2008-02-27 links to the first hour of 2008-02-28, and the last hour of 2008-02-28 links back to the first hour of 2008-02-27.
If a stress period has no consecutively adjacent stress periods, it is modeled with periodic boundary conditions linking the last hour of the period to the first hour of the same period
(the same treatment as representative periods, as long as <a class="reference internal" href="#inter-day-storage-operation"><span class="xref myst">interday storage operation</span></a> is not enabled).</p></li>
<li><p>Interregional transmission flows are allowed during stress periods by default, allowing interregional coordination to help meet resource adequacy needs.
New transmission capacity is derated by 15% during stress periods to approximate contingency considerations.</p></li>
<li><p>Coincident net imports into NERC regions (<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-hierarchy"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 17</span></a>) during stress periods are by default limited to historical peak net firm capacity transfers from <span id="id182">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1786" title="NERC. 2023 Long-term reliability assessment.

<p>As shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-ra-flowcharts"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 53</span></a>, the iterative ReEDS-PRAS procedure begins with a set of “seed” stress periods for each model year.
Seed stress periods are included because <a class="reference internal" href="#representative-periods"><span class="xref myst">representative periods</span></a> do not, in general, include outlying periods (such as peak demand days) that drive capacity investments.
A system planned only with representative periods would therefore almost certainly fail to meet resource adequacy targets when considering a broader collection of weather and demand conditions,
and the inclusion of seed stress periods allows this initial failing iteration to be skipped, reducing runtime.</p>
<p>By default, seed stress periods include peak demand days by planning subregion for each model year, in addition to minimum availability days for solar and wind by interconnection (shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-ra-seed-stressperiods"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 54</span></a> for an illustrative high-electrification scenario).</p>

<h4>Iteration between ReEDS and PRAS<a class="headerlink" href="#iteration-between-reeds-and-pras" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>The PRAS model calculates (among other quantities) the hourly expected unserved energy (EUE) in each model zone across a user-defined number of Monte Carlo samples (10 samples by default).
The hourly EUE profiles are summed at the resolution used for RA assessment (the 18 planning subregions by default) and divided by total electricity demand to determine the normalized EUE (NEUE).
The NEUE in each region is then compared to the user-specified reliability threshold;
if any regions do not meet the specified threshold,
the days with highest EUE in the failing regions are added as “dynamic” stress periods (<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-ra-flowcharts"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 53</span></a>)
and another ReEDS-PRAS iteration is performed.
This process is illustrated graphically in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-ra-iteration-example"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 56</span></a>.

<h3>Capacity Credit RA Method<a class="headerlink" href="#capacity-credit-ra-method" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>

<section id="vre-capacity-credit">
<h4>VRE capacity credit<a class="headerlink" href="#vre-capacity-credit" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>For VRE technologies (i.e., wind and solar), ReEDS estimates a seasonal capacity credit for each region/class combination via an hourly LDC approximation of effective load carrying capability (ELCC)<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref40" id="id189" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>25<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> performed between solve years.
ELCC can be described as the amount of additional load that can be accommodated by adding those generators while maintaining a constant reliability level.
The “8760-based” methodology can capture the highest load and net load hours, which typically represent the highest-risk hours, and can thereby support a reasonable representation of capacity credit.
Details of this LDC approach as well as a comparison against a former statistical method can be found in <span id="id190">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1051" title="Bethany Frew, Wesley Cole, Yinong Sun, James Richards, and Trieu Mai. 8760-Based Method for Representing Variable Generation Capacity Value in Capacity Expansion Models. In 2017 International Energy Workshop. College Park, MD, 2017. International Energy Workshop. URL: https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/68869.pdf.">Frew <em>et al.</em>, 2017</a>]</span>, although that approach has been expanded to consider multiple <a class="reference internal" href="#weather-years"><span class="xref myst">weather years</span></a> of wind, solar, and load data rather than just a single year.</p>
<p>The LDC approach for calculating capacity credit is based on explicit hourly tracking of time-synchronous load and VRE resources.
The capacity credit method uses a capacity factor proxy that is applied to the top 20 hours (by default) in load and net load-duration curves (LDCs and NLDCs) in each season to estimate ELCC by season.
<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-cv-calculation-ldc-approach"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 59</span></a> graphically represents the ReEDS capacity credit methodology.
The LDC reflects the total load in a given modeling region, which is sorted from the hours of highest load to lowest load and is shown by the blue line.
The NLDC represents the total load minus the time-synchronous contribution of VRE, where the resulting net load is then sorted from highest to lowest, as shown by the solid red line.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref42" id="id191" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>26<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> The NLDC(δ), which represents further addition of VRE resources, can be created by subtracting the time-synchronous generation of an incremental capacity addition from the NLDC, where the resulting time series is again sorted from highest to lowest; this is shown by the dashed red line.</p>

</figure>
<p>ReEDS calculates the ELCC as the difference in the areas between the LDC and NLDC during the top 20 hours of the duration curves in each season, as represented by the dark blue shaded area in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-cv-calculation-ldc-approach"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 59</span></a>.
These 20 hours are a proxy for the hours with the highest risk for loss of load (i.e., the loss of load probability).
Similarly, the contribution of an additional unit of capacity to meeting peak load is the difference in the areas between the NLDC and the NLDC(δ), as shown by the light blue shaded area in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-cv-calculation-ldc-approach"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 59</span></a>.
To ensure resource adequacy, ReEDS calculates capacity credit based on a 1,000-MW incremental capacity size of new solar and wind builds.
These areas are then divided by the corresponding installed capacity and number of top hours to obtain a fractional seasonal-based capacity credit.</p>
<p>The resulting existing and marginal capacity credit<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref44" id="id192" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>27<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> values then feed into ReEDS to quantify each VRE resource’s capacity contribution to the planning reserve requirement.
Existing VRE capacity credit calculations are performed by region and technology.
For all candidate VRE resources that might be built in the coming year, the <em>marginal</em> capacity credit is calculated by region, technology, and resource class.
In all cases, the VRE profile is compared against the aggregated regional load profile for determining the capacity credit (<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-cv-calculation-ldc-approach"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 59</span></a>).</p>

<section id="existing-fleet-cooling-technology-and-water-source">
<h3>Existing Fleet Cooling Technology and Water Source<a class="headerlink" href="#existing-fleet-cooling-technology-and-water-source" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Thermal generating technologies in ReEDS are differentiated by the following cooling technology types: once-through, recirculating, pond, and dry(air)-cooled.
Cooling technologies determine water withdrawal and consumption rates and affect capital cost, operating cost, and heat rate as described in the <a class="reference internal" href="#cooling-system-cost-and-performance"><span class="xref myst">Cooling System Cost and Performance section</span></a>.
Generating technologies without cooling systems are designated as having no cooling; however, these technologies can still be assigned water withdrawal and consumption rates to account for processes such as evaporation from hydropower reservoirs or cleaning PV arrays.
All power-cooling technology combinations (including water-using technologies without cooling) are also assigned one of the following six water source types included in the model: fresh surface water that is currently appropriated, unassigned/unappropriated fresh surface water, fresh groundwater, brackish or saline groundwater, saline surface water, and wastewater treatment facility effluent.
These water source types align with the water supply curves described in <a class="reference internal" href="#water-availability-and-cost"><span class="xref myst">Water Availability and Cost</span></a>.
Appropiation of water refers to how water rights are assigned in the western United States, so no regions in the East have appropriated water.
Representing both cooling technology and water source allows a high-fidelity representation of water source-sink relationships and constraints by enumerating all available power technology, cooling technology, and water source combinations within the ReEDS technology set.</p>
<p>Cooling technology and water source of the baseline 2010 generation fleet and subsequent prescribed builds are assigned using several data sources mapped to the unit database that exogenously defines capital stock in ReEDS.
The EIA NEMS unit database is first merged with the 2018 version of the EIA thermoelectric cooling water dataset <span id="id197">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2224" title="USEIA. Thermoelectric cooling water data. 2018. URL: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/water/ (visited on 2020-12-30).">USEIA, 2018</a>]</span>.
Cooling technology assignment uses the “860 Cooling Type 1” field where possible, followed by the “860 Cooling Type 2” and finally “923 Cooling Type.”
Hybrid cooling systems are assigned as recirculating except for hybrid dry/induced draft systems, which are assigned as dry cooling.
Any remaining gaps in cooling technology assignment are filled using the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) EW3 Energy-Water Database <span id="id198">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2212" title="Union of Concerned Scientists. UCS EW3 Energy-Water Database V.1.3. 2012. URL: www.ucsusa.org/ew3database (visited on 2016-09-30).">Union of Concerned Scientists, 2012</a>]</span>.
This procedure enables annual updates through yearly reporting of EIA thermoelectric cooling water data.
Thermal units with no available information on cooling technology are assigned recirculating cooling by default.</p>
<p>Water source in ReEDS is assigned where possible using the “Water Type” and “Water Source” fields in the EIA cooling water dataset and then supplemented using raw EIA Form 860 plant-level data <span id="id199">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1039" title="Form EIA-860 detailed data with previous form data (EIA-860A/860B). 2018. URL: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/ (visited on 2020-12-30)."><em>Form EIA-860 Detailed Data with Previous Form Data (EIA-860A/860B)</em>, 2018</a>]</span>.
When the water source is unclear from the type and source, the “Water Source Name” is used to help discern additional water source types and determine which units use municipal water.
Municipal water is treated as an intermediary of the ultimate water source, which is defined using U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) water use data for 2015 that include water sources for municipal use <span id="id200">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id749" title="Cheryl A. Dieter and Kristin S. Linsey. Estimated Use of Water in the United States County-Level Data for 2015. 2017. URL: https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/get/5af3311be4b0da30c1b245d8 (visited on 2020-12-30), doi:10.5066/F7TB15V5.">Dieter and Linsey, 2017</a>]</span>.
Generating units that use municipal water are assigned the water source that supplies the majority of municipal water use in the USGS database.
The UCS EW3 database is also used to assign water sources unavailable in EIA data <span id="id201">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2212" title="Union of Concerned Scientists. UCS EW3 Energy-Water Database V.1.3. 2012. URL: www.ucsusa.org/ew3database (visited on 2016-09-30).">Union of Concerned Scientists, 2012</a>]</span>.
Remaining unknown water source types are assigned from USGS data using the majority water source for the power sector, further differentiated by once-through or recirculating cooling.
If there are no USGS data for power sector water use in the relevant county, the majority source of overall water use is applied.</p>
<p>Beyond this multidatabase approach to assign cooling technology and water source, water source must be reassigned for some prescribed new builds if the water availability described in <a class="reference internal" href="#water-availability-and-cost"><span class="xref myst">Water Availability and Cost</span></a> is insufficient for that unit’s water needs.
For these instances, a final adjustment procedure that temporarily relaxes water use constraints is used to identify these units and manually modify water source types to use the zone’s least-cost water source with sufficient availability for the prescribed unit.</p>

<p>Water use is also characterized and constrained for hydropower, gas-CT, geothermal, and distributed rooftop PV technologies, albeit without cooling technology disaggregation.
This construct allows total power sector water use to be estimated and enables expansion in later model versions, particularly for geothermal technologies.</p>
<p>Some power-cooling technology pairs are also prohibited for new construction by default.
New, nonprescribed capacity for all technologies cannot use once-through cooling because of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations and industry trends <span id="id202">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id935" title="EPA. 40 CFR Parts 122 and 125. Technical Report Vol. 79, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2014. URL: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2014-08-15/pdf/2014-12164.pdf.">EPA, 2014</a>]</span>.
In addition, all new nonprescribed capacity cannot choose pond cooling because pond cooling designs are site-dependent, and ReEDS does not have sufficient detail to characterize location-specific cooling pond design.
The model also prevents new nuclear and coal-CCS capacity from using dry cooling because existing designs have very high cooling requirements where dry cooling is considered impractical.
These restrictions can be relaxed with minor code modifications.</p>
<p>Cooling technology affects capital cost, variable operating cost, heat rate, water withdrawal rate, and water consumption rate.
Cost and heat rate are adjusted for cooling technology by multiplying baseline technology data by the factors in <a class="reference internal" href="#capital-cost-multipliers"><span class="std std-numref">Table 16</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#variable-operations-capital-cost-multipliers"><span class="std std-numref">Table 17</span></a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="#heat-rate-multipliers"><span class="std std-numref">Table 18</span></a>.
Recirculating cooling is the reference cooling technology except for CSP, where dry cooling is the reference technology <span id="id203">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1564" title="J. Macknick, R. Newmark, G. Heath, and K. C. Hallett. Operational water consumption and withdrawal factors for electricity generating technologies: a review of existing literature. Environmental Research Letters, 7(4):045802, 2012. URL: http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/7/i=4/a=045802 (visited on 2016-09-29), doi:10.1088/1748-9326/7/4/045802.">Macknick <em>et al.</em>, 2012</a>]</span>.
Typically, once-through cooling systems are less expensive and allow higher overall thermal efficiency, whereas dry cooling is more expensive and results in lower net thermal efficiency.
Pond cooling systems are typically intermediate to once-through and recirculating cooling, but the model uses once-through cooling characteristics as an approximation because actual cost and performance is site-specific.
No data exist for some power-cooling technology combinations (gas-CC-CCS + once-through and pond; coal-CCS + pond, CSP + once-through and pond) because no existing or planned units of those types exist.</p>

<h3>Water Availability and Cost<a class="headerlink" href="#water-availability-and-cost" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>When water constraints are active, all generating capacity that exists in a given model year is required to have access to water if that technology uses water.
The quantity of required water access is defined conservatively to ensure sufficient water is available to generate at maximum power output during the expected annual low water flow condition.
To align with annualized water availability data, this requirement is formulated as the annual volume of water needed to operate continuously at maximum output for the entire year (100% capacity factor), i.e., the product of generating capacity (MW), water use rate (gal/MWh), and 8760 hours per year.
For capacity that uses surface water, water access requirements are based on the water consumption rate to account for the return of most withdrawn water directly to the water source at the site of withdrawal.
For all other water sources, requirements are based on withdrawal rates, because these water types (e.g., groundwater, saline surface water, wastewater effluent) are not generally returned to the site of withdrawal.</p>
<p>Generating capacity in the initial 2010 model year is assumed to have secured sufficient water access prior to 2010.
However, any new prescribed or optimized investments must procure water access from a power sector water availability supply curve developed by Sandia National Laboratories <span id="id205">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2169" title="Vincent C.

For use in ReEDS, water availability and cost are aggregated to zonal resolution for each of five water source types: fresh surface water that is currently appropriated, unassigned/unappropriated fresh surface water, fresh groundwater, brackish or saline groundwater, and wastewater treatment facility effluent.
Saline surface water is available to existing capacity that currently uses it but is assumed unavailable to new capacity because of current regulatory constraints and industry expectations <span id="id206">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id935" title="EPA. 40 CFR Parts 122 and 125.

Costs include both capital and annualized operating costs associated with each water source.
Unassigned/unappropriated fresh surface water is assumed to have negligible access cost, and costs typically increase in the order of fresh groundwater, appropriated fresh surface water, wastewater, and brackish/saline groundwater.
Appropriated water is relevant only to western U.S. water law, so there is no appropriated water in the East, and many western regions lack unappropriated water (i.e., 100% of total water is appropriated).</p>
<p>Total water available to the power sector is the sum of the supply curve for new capacity and the initially assumed water availability based on the water use of the fleet in the initial 2010 model year.
Thus, when generating capacity retires, its water access is automatically available to any new capacity at the cost associated with the capacity’s water source type and region.
For the initial 2010 fleet, all capacity that uses fresh surface water is designated as using the “appropriated fresh surface water” category so retired water access is assigned the cost of other appropriated water in that region.
For the eastern United States where water appropriation is inapplicable, retired fresh surface water access is assigned a small nominal cost to avoid overprocurement of water in the model.
This structure implies any water access owned by the power sector remains in the power sector and increased competition within or outside the power sector does not affect water supply or cost.
Scenario analysis and future model development could explore this assumption in greater detail.</p>
<p>Similar to retirements, changes in water needs because of upgrades or refurbishments are also accounted for in the water access requirement.
This is particularly relevant to CCS upgrades, which substantially increase water use rates given the CCS technologies assumed in the model.</p>

<h3>Water Constraints<a class="headerlink" href="#water-constraints" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Several model constraints govern the ReEDS power sector water use formulation.
Water withdrawal and consumption quantities are tracked for each power technology, cooling technology, water source, power technology vintage, zone, time slice, and year, providing high resolution with which to examine power sector water use.
Separately, water access requirements are related explicitly to the capacity available for each power technology, cooling technology, water source, power technology vintage, zone, and year based on either the withdrawal or consumption rate as described in the <a class="reference internal" href="#water-availability-and-cost"><span class="xref myst">Water Availability and Cost section</span></a>.
This water access is then limited by the total access available for each water source and region as defined by the water allocation in 2010 and the supply available to post-2010 capacity.</p>
<p>Quantities of water used for each power technology, cooling technology, water source, power technology vintage, and zone are then constrained within each representative day based on an assumed quarterly (winter, spring, summer, fall) allocation of available water access and the relative weight of each quarter in each representative day.
Water access must be purchased from the water availability supply curve before water can be used.
Hydrology data are used to define the quarterly allocation of unassigned/unappropriated fresh surface water <span id="id208">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1565" title="Jordan Macknick, Stuart Cohen, Robin Newmark, Andrew Martinez, Patrick Sullivan, and Vince Tidwell.

Additional resolution for intraannual water allocation or the potential for changes over time requires additional data, but the framework generally allows the capability to incentivize water sources that are more available when electricity demands are higher.</p>

For existing coal plants, ReEDS models an emissions rate-based compliance mechanism, enforced at the state level.
In 2032 and for every year thereafter, the emissions rate (metric tons CO<sub>2</sub> per MWh) of a state’s coal fleet must be less than or equal to the emissions rate of a coal-CCS plant with a 90% capture rate.
This enables some unabated coal plants to remain online after 2032 if that state also has coal-CCS plants with high capture rates that stay online and generate, decreasing the average emissions rate.
Also starting in 2032, new gas plants must either retrofit with CCS or operate below a 40% capacity factor.

<h4>California carbon cap<a class="headerlink" href="#california-carbon-cap" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>California’s Global Warming Solution Act of 2016 (referred to as Assembly Bill 398 or AB 398) established a program to reduce economywide greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.
In 2016, legislation was passed that codified the 2030 greenhouse gas target to 40% below 1990 levels.
In ReEDS, these state carbon caps are modeled as a cap on electricity-system CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from generators either located in California or serving load in the state.
Direct CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from generators located in California count toward the cap.
For imported electricity, the model calculates the regional emissions rate (metric tons CO<sub>2</sub>/MWh) after each solve year and then apply that rate to imports in the next solve year.
In scenarios that also have a national carbon cap that reaches zero emissions, the emission intensity of California imports is also set to zero for years when the national carbon cap is zero.</p>
<p>Because California’s greenhouse gas reduction targets are legislated for all economic sectors whereas ReEDS models only the electricity sector, we rely on published economywide modeling results to estimate electric-sector-specific caps that are used in ReEDS.
In particular, we apply power sector caps based on the annual California electric sector emissions (from in-state and imported electricity) from California Public Utilities Commission <span id="id211">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id669" title="CPUC.

The sum for the column “CO<sub>2</sub> Allowance or Base Budget” was used (total number of CO<sub>2</sub> allowances allocated by each state).
This column was used because it best represents the total CO<sub>2</sub> amounts that are permitted to be emitted.
The “CO<sub>2</sub>, Allowance Adjusted Budget” column, for example, shows the budgets of each state after the banked allowances have been subtracted from the base budget.
Banked allowances are stored CO<sub>2</sub> allowances that have accumulated through the previous control periods, which are roughly the previous 4–5 years.
Future RGGI allowances (regional scale) through 2030 were provided by RGGI employee Cooper Tamayo.

<h4>Federal tax credits for clean electricity and captured carbon<a class="headerlink" href="#federal-tax-credits-for-clean-electricity-and-captured-carbon" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Existing federal tax incentives are included in ReEDS, aligned with the IRA.
These include the production tax credit (PTC) and the ITC for clean electricity, the 45Q credit for capturing and storing carbon, the 45U credits for existing nuclear generation, the 45V credit for producing hydrogen, and the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) depreciation schedules.
<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref52" id="id212" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>28<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> Current technology-specific depreciation schedules are modeled for all years because we assume they are permanent parts of the tax code.</p>
<p>Four clean electricity production and investment tax credits are represented in ReEDS:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC):</strong> $26/MWh for 10 years (2022 dollars) plus a bonus credit that starts at $1.3/MWh and increases to $2.6/MWh by 2028.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (ITC):</strong> 30%, plus a domestic content bonus credit that starts at an additional 2.5% and increases to 5% by 2028 (for totals of 32.5% and 35%, respectively).
Energy community bonuses are also applied based on the location of the new build, with an additional 10% bonus for building within an energy community.
For ReEDS regions that are only partially covered by energy communities, the 10% bonus is derated by the portion of the region (by land area) that is made up of energy communities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Captured CO<sub>2</sub> Incentive (45Q):</strong> $85 per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> for 12 years for fossil-CCS and bioenergy-CCS and $180 per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> for 12 years for direct air capture; nominal through 2026 and inflation adjusted after that.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Existing Nuclear Production Tax Credit (45U):</strong> This tax credit is $15/MWh (2022 dollars), but it is reduced if the market value of the electricity produced by the generator exceeds $25/MWh.
As a simplification, this dynamic calculation was not directly represented in ReEDS.
Instead, to represent the effect of this provision, existing nuclear generators are not subject to economic retirement in ReEDS through 2032.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (45V):</strong> Up to $3/kg of hydrogen produced, based on the life-cycle emissions of hydrogen production, with more emitting generation able to claim lower levels of the tax credit.
$3/kg is in $2022 and the credit amount is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.taxnotes.com/research/federal/irs-guidance/notices/irs-releases-clean-hydrogen-credit-inflation-adjustment/7kd80">inflation adjusted in subsequent years</a>.
ReEDS assumes the $3/kg credit is sufficient incentive for all hydrogen producers to comply with the mechanisms required to prove the cleanliness of their electricity and therefore allow only generation technologies that qualify for the lowest life-cycle emissions category to contribute.
To ensure the low carbon intensity of their electricity and to receive the 45V credit, hydrogen producers must purchase and retire energy attribute credits (EACs) for all electricity they consume.
The generation resources that produce EACs are subject to the “three pillars”—incrementality, time-matching, and deliverability, as described in the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-31513/credit-for-production-of-clean-hydrogen-and-energy-credit">final rules</a> released by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in January 2025.
ReEDS uses a simplified representation of the incrementality pillar, stating all generators with a commercial online date of 2024 or later qualify as an EAC producer, and does not represent the additional pathways for nuclear plants, CCS plants, and states with robust greenhouse gas emission caps to qualify.
ReEDS models the time-matching and deliverability pillars as written in the final rules, where EACs must be purchased and retired in the same year (pre-2030) or hour (post-2030) and geographic region that they are produced.
The ITC or PTC can be stacked with 45V; i.e., a wind plant can receive both the PTC and 45V for its generation.
However, 45V and 45Q cannot both be claimed by the same plant; i.e., a steam methane reforming plant with CCS cannot claim both 45V and 45Q.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note IRA allows for bonus credits for both the clean electricity PTC and ITC (but not applicable to 45U or 45Q) if a project either meets certain domestic manufacturing requirements or is in an energy community. Projects can obtain both bonus credits if they meet both requirements, which would equate to $5.2/MWh for the PTC and 20% for the ITC.
In ReEDS, this is simplified according to the summary above.
In practice, there will likely be greater diversity of captured credits among projects.
Relatedly, the values above are based on the assumption that all projects will meet the prevailing wage requirements.</p>
<p>Under IRA, eligible clean electricity projects can select whether to take the PTC or the ITC.
As implemented in ReEDS, however, an a priori analysis was performed to estimate which credit was most likely to be more valuable, and the technology was assigned that credit.
The assignments are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>PTC:</strong> Land-based wind, utility-scale PV, and biopower</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ITC:</strong> Offshore wind, CSP, geothermal, hydropower, new nuclear (both conventional and SMR), PSH, distributed PV, and batteries.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>PV-battery gets both the PTC and ITC in ReEDS.
PTC is applied only to the PV portions of PVB generation, and ITC is applied to the battery component.</p>
<p>As represented in ReEDS, the value of the tax credits is reduced by 10% for non-CCS technologies and 7.5% for CCS technologies, as a simple approximation of the costs of monetizing the tax credits (such as tax equity financing).<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref53" id="id213" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>29<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> These cost penalties are not reflected in the values given for each incentive above.</p>
<p>The clean electricity PTC and ITC are scheduled to start phasing out when electricity sector greenhouse gas emissions fall below 25% of 2022 levels, or 2032, whichever is later.
Once the tax credits phase out, they remain at zero—there is no reactivation of the credits if the emissions threshold is exceeded at a later point.
The exact value of the threshold that would trigger the IRA clean electricity tax credits phasing out has not been announced but is estimated at 386 million metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e in this modeling.
The 45Q, 45U, and 45V credits do not have a dynamic phaseout and are instead scheduled to end at the end of 2032 (adjusted for under-construction provisions).</p>
<p>In the dGen model, distributed PV is assumed to take an ITC: the 25D credit for residential, and the Section 48 credit for commercial and industrial.
For residential projects placed in service through 2032, the ITC is assumed to be 30%, declining to zero for projects placed in service in 2036.
For commercial and industrial projects coming online through 2035, the ITC is assumed to be 40%, dropping to zero after that.
These representations are simplifications because there can be greater diversity in captured value depending on factors such as ownership type and tax status.
Furthermore, because of limitations of the models used in this study, the dynamic phaseout of the Section 48 ITC is not reflected.
In practice, most scenarios did not cross the emissions threshold specified in IRA at this point, and therefore the adoption of commercial and industrial distributed PV in the later years of those scenarios is potentially underestimated.
A tax credit extension scenario provides a view of distributed PV deployment without a phaseout.</p>
<p>IRA includes additional bonus credits (up to 20%) for up to 1.8 GW per year for solar facilities that are placed in service in low-income communities.
The dGen model runs used in ReEDS does not have an explicit representation of that additional bonus credit.
Instead, 0.9 GW per year of distributed PV was added to the original dGen estimates through 2032.
The estimate of 0.9 GW reflects the assumption that some of the projects capturing the bonus credit may not be additional (i.e., they would have occurred anyway even if the bonus credit was not available).
The 0.9 GW per year is added in such a way that the spatial distribution of distributed PV remains unchanged.</p>
<p>All the IRA tax credits are assumed to have safe harbor periods, meaning a technology can capture a credit as long as it started construction before the expiration of the tax credit.
The maximum safe harbor periods are assumed to be 10 years for offshore wind, 6 years for CCS and nuclear, and 4 years for all other technologies.
Generators will obtain the largest credit available within their safe harbor window, meaning once a credit starts to phase down or terminate, ReEDS assumes efforts were made to start construction at the maximum length of the safe harbor window before the unit came online.
In practice, this means ReEDS will show generators coming online and capturing the tax credits for several years beyond the nominal year in which they expired.</p>

<h3>State Renewable Portfolio Standards<a class="headerlink" href="#state-renewable-portfolio-standards" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>ReEDS models state RPSs, including technology set-asides and renewable energy certificates (RECs) that can count toward RPS compliance.
RPS rules are complex and can vary significantly between states.
The RPS representation in ReEDS attempts to model the primary impacts of these RPS rules but includes many simplifying assumptions.
In addition, in recent years there have been numerous changes to RPS legislation.
We periodically update our representation to capture the recent changes to the legislation; however, the numerous and frequent changes to state laws create challenges to having a precise representation of all RPS legislation.</p>
<p>RPS targets—along with many other data that we use to represent nuanced RPS rules—are based on data compiled by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which takes into account the in-state REC multiplier incentives and load adjustments (e.g., sales-weighted RPS targets considering different load-serving entities subject to compliance, such as investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities, and cooperatives) <span id="id214">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id362" title="Galen Barbose.

Solar includes UPV and ro­oftop PV, wind includes both land-based and offshore technologies, and distributed generation (DG) includes rooftop PV and ground-mounted PV systems located within the distribution network.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref55" id="id215" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>30<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> ReEDS also models alternative compliance payments for unmet RPS requirement for both main RPS targets and solar/wind set-asides as is consistent with the available data.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">RPS input data</p>
<p>RPS targets and technology set-asides for 2010-2050 can be found in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/inputs/state_policies/rps_fraction.csv</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<p>Technology eligibility for state RPS requirements is modeled for each state.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref55" id="id216" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>30<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> For instance, California’s RPS does not allow in-state rooftop solar technologies to contribute toward its RPS.
In addition, every state has specific rules regarding hydropower generation’s eligibility toward contributing RECs, which are usually based on each unit’s vintage and size (e.g., small hydropower with specific capacity cutoffs are eligible in some states).
ReEDS models these as allowable generation fractions from Barbose <span id="id217"><a class="reference internal" href="#id362" title="Galen Barbose. U.S. State Renewables Portfolio &amp; Clean Electricity Standards: 2024 Status Update. Technical Report, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, 2024.

<p>Except for California, ReEDS enforces an upper limit on the total RECs (both bundled and unbundled) that can be imported for that state’s RPS compliance.
For California alone, because of its unique out-of-state rules, ReEDS enforces two upper limits: one on the total unbundled REC imports and the other on the total bundled REC imports.
There are myriad possibilities of interstate REC transactions, in terms of both which two states can transact and the quantity of those transactions.
To constrain the solution space of ReEDS to credible values, the interstate REC trading modeling is based on historical observations <span id="id218">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1262" title="Ed Holt.

The out-of-state total REC import percentages for each state are limited to those observed in 2012–2013 <span id="id219">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1217" title="Jenny Heeter. Cross-state RPS Visualization. 2015. URL: http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/docs/index.html (visited on 2016-11-04).">Heeter, 2015</a>]</span> with additional updates made over the years based on state input and observed trading behavior.</p>
<p>To prevent laundering of credits through two states that are not allowed to trade but have a common trading partner, ReEDS includes a requirement that a state may not export more credits than it can produce.
If a state is using alternative compliance payments to meet its RPS or clean energy standard (CES) requirement, that state is further limited in its ability to export credits.</p>
<p>Several states have implemented policies directed at offshore wind.
To represent these actions in ReEDS, we prescribe a floor to offshore wind capacity based on known projects and policy mandates.
Specifically, we include offshore wind capacity that meets at least one of three criteria: current operating capacity, projects in active solicitation processes, and statutory policy requirements.
The projects are based on tracking conducted for the NREL Offshore Wind Technologies Market Report, and state totals are shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#offshore-wind-capacity"><span class="std std-numref">Table 23</span></a>.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#refoffshorenote" id="id220" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>31<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> The model allows economic deployment of offshore wind capacity beyond these levels.
All policy-mandated offshore wind capacity is assumed to be rebuilt if retiring the capacity would bring the total below the mandated limit.</p>
<p>Finally, voluntary renewable energy credits are also represented in ReEDS.
Only renewable energy technologies are allowed to supply voluntary RECs, and Canadian imports are not allowed.
The voluntary REC requirement is based on the observed amount of voluntary RECs from <span id="id221">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1218" title="Jenny Heeter, Eric O'Shaughnessy, and Rebecca Burd. Status and Trends in the Voluntary Market (2020 Data).

The voluntary requirement includes an alternative compliance payment of $10/MWh (in 2004$).</p>

<h3>Clean Energy Standards<a class="headerlink" href="#clean-energy-standards" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>As of November 2024, 16 states had clean energy standards (see <a class="reference internal" href="#clean-energy-req"><span class="std std-numref">Table 24</span></a>).
CES values are effective values<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref56" id="id222" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>32<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> and are taken from <span id="id223">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id362" title="Galen Barbose.

These CESs are in effect generalized versions of RPSs; their model representations are very similar with technology eligibility being the primary difference.</p>
<div class="admonition-ces-input-data admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">CES input data</p>
<p>The annual compliance for states with a CES policy can be found in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inputs/state_policies/ces_fraction.csv</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<p>For all but one of the CES policies (Massachusetts), we assume all zero-carbon-emitting sources (on a direct emissions basis) can contribute to the CES requirement.
This includes all renewable energy technologies (including hydropower and distributed PV), nuclear power, and imports from Canada.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref57" id="id224" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>33<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> The modeled CES policies set a floor on electricity generated from clean energy technologies but does not cap generation from conventional sources.
As a result, in the model representation, a state can continue to generate from existing fossil plants if the amount of clean energy generation exceeds the requirement (even if the requirement approaches 100% of sales).
Most of the CES policies are assumed to start in 2030 and ramp to their final targets by 2040 or 2050.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref58" id="id225" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>34<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>
For other aspects of the CES model representation, we use the same assumptions as the corresponding state RPS.
These include assumptions about credit trading and variations in load-serving entity requirements.
In the case of Virginia, fossil plants are required to retire according to the schedule indicated in the clean energy policy.
Based on discussions with stakeholders, fossil plants in Illinois and New York are also required to retire once the policy reaches the nominal 100% target.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref59" id="id226" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>35<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

<p>There are four states that have enacted policies that provide compensation or other assistance for in-state nuclear power plants: Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York.
For these states, the nuclear power plants are not allowed to retire until after the policy expires, unless the power plant already has an announced retirement date.
The policy end dates are taken from EIA <span id="id227"><a class="reference internal" href="#id877" title="EIA. Electric Power Monthly. Technical Report, U.S. Energy Information Agency, Washington, D.C., February 2019. URL: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/.">2019</a></span>.</p>

<h3>Other Policy Capabilities<a class="headerlink" href="#other-policy-capabilities" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>In addition to the existing policies described above, ReEDS also includes several optional policy implementations that are useful for exploring alternative futures or the impact of existing policies.
These additional policy frameworks include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>National Clean Energy Standard:</strong> This framework allows the user to specify which technologies count as “clean energy” and enforce a minimum limit for the generation fraction of these clean energy technologies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>National Renewable Portfolio Standard:</strong> This standard enforces a national RPS, with the RPS trajectory defined by the user.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Carbon Cap-and-Trade:</strong> This feature allows the user to specify national or subnational carbon cap-and-trade policies, including options to represent trading limitations and banking and borrowing of allowances.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Carbon Tax:</strong> This feature implements a user-specified carbon tax on burner-tip emissions from the power sector.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>National Emissions Limit:</strong> This framework limits the total national emissions according to user-specified values.
The limit is often referred to as a carbon cap or CO<sub>2</sub> cap.</p></li>

The ATB has technology-specific and time-varying financing parameters, including interest rate, rate of return on equity, debt fraction, and tax rate.
Other elements of the ATB included in ReEDS include construction schedules, MACRS depreciation schedules, and inflation rates.
These values are further defined and explained in the ATB, with additional explanation of our financing implementation detailed in the <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-capital-cost-financial-multipliers">(6)</a> of the appendix.</p>
<p>Cost calculations within the model are done assuming a 30-year economic lifetime for all generation assets (transmission lines and AC/DC converters have a 40-year economic lifetime).
Technologies with a physical lifetime shorter than the economic lifetime have a penalty applied to reflect the need for a replacement before the end of the economic life.</p>

<section id="electric-sector-costs">
<h3>Electric Sector Costs<a class="headerlink" href="#electric-sector-costs" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Two systemwide cost metrics are calculated from each ReEDS run: a present value of direct electric sector system costs and electricity price.
These cost calculations are not part of the ReEDS optimization process; they are calculated after the ReEDS optimizations have been conducted.
ReEDS also includes a postprocessing option for estimating retail rates and for estimating the health costs of air pollution, described further below.</p>
<section id="present-value-of-direct-electric-sector-cost">
<h4>Present value of direct electric sector cost<a class="headerlink" href="#present-value-of-direct-electric-sector-cost" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>The present value system cost metric accounts for capital and operating expenditures incurred over the entire study horizon for all technology types considered, including generation, transmission, and storage.
The cost in each future year is discounted by a social discount rate, by default set to 2% <span id="id229">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1830" title="OMB. Circular A-4.

The social discount rate is not to be confused with the <em>investment</em> discount rate used in the optimization for investment decisions;
the investment discount rate is selected to represent private-sector investment decisions for electric system infrastructure, and it approximates the expected market rate of return of investors.
Capital costs incurred before the start of the specified economic horizon are annualized and included in the system cost metric.

This calculation takes advantage of the linear programming formulation of the model.
Specifically, the marginal price on a model constraint represents how much the objective function would change given a change in the right side of the constraint.
Each constraint can be viewed as a market with a marginal price and quantity.
At optimality, the total revenue (i.e., the product of price and quantity) across all constraints equals the objective function value.
The constraints within ReEDS are written so the marginal values from the load constraints can be used as a proxy for the competitive electricity price.
The load constraints are linked to the supply-demand balance constraints, capacity constraints, operating reserve constraints, and others through load variables.
Taking the marginal value from the load balance constraint, we can find the marginal value of an additional unit of load (e.g., MWh) to the system, accounting for other requirements.
Specifically, the reported competitive prices in ReEDS capture five categories of requirements: energy, capacity, operating reserves, and state-level and national-level RPS requirements (see <a class="reference internal" href="#grid-service-constraints"><span class="std std-numref">Table 26</span></a>).
The competitive prices can be reported at different regional aggregation levels, scaled by requirement quantities.
Details about how these prices are calculated in ReEDS can be found in the Marginal Electricity Prices section of the appendix.</p>

<p>Besides “competitive electricity prices,” ReEDS also calculates the average cost of electricity at the national, zonal, or state level by taking the annualized total costs of building and operating the system in a specific geographic area and dividing that by the electricity load in that area.
Annualized costs for existing (i.e., pre-2010) power plants are also considered given plants’ initial investment costs and the build year.
Zonal average electricity prices also consider the impact of energy and capacity trading.
These prices reflect the average costs to serve the load in certain areas.
Detailed calculation equations can be found in the Average Electricity Prices section of the appendix.</p>

<section id="retail-rates">
<h4>Retail rates<a class="headerlink" href="#retail-rates" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>ReEDS estimates average retail electricity rates using the method described by <span id="id231">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id490" title="Patrick R. Brown, Pieter J. Gagnon, J.

This retail rate method is a separate module run after a ReEDS run has been completed.
It uses a detailed bottom-up accounting method for projecting retail rates based on the ReEDS buildout and operation.
It uses an accounting framework most aligned with an investor-owned utility and accounts for depreciation, taxes, and the breakdown between operating and capitalized (rate-based)
expenses.
Distribution, administration, and intraregional transmission costs are projected forward based
on empirical trends from 2010 to 2019.
For more details on the method, see <span id="id232">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id490" title="Patrick R. Brown, Pieter J. Gagnon, J. Sean Corcoran, and Wesley J. Cole.

<p>The retail rate method has since been expanded to handle negative emission technology cost allocation.
Because the retail rate method reports state-level average retail rates, if one state builds a negative emission technology such as DAC or BECCS, that state will incur the costs even though the emissions offset by that unit are likely to be from another state.
The retail rate method allocates the cost of the negative emission technology to the states with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, weighted by the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

<p>In addition to direct system costs, ReEDS also includes a postprocessing step for estimating health damages associated with air pollution.
Currently this focuses on mortality from long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) from fossil fuel combustion in the electric sector.

<p>To estimate health damages, ReEDS relies on estimates of the mortality risk per tonne of emissions from three reduced complexity air quality models (AP2, EASIUR, and InMAP) <span id="id235">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id558" title="Center for Air, Climate, and Energy Solutions. Data Download. 2025. URL: https://www.caces.us/data.">Center for Air, Climate, and Energy Solutions, 2025</a>]</span>.
Each of these models estimates PM<sub>2.5</sub> formation associated with emissions of precursor pollutants (NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>).
To generate annualized premature mortality, each model applies a concentration response function from one of two studies linking exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> to increased mortality risk.
These two studies, referred to as the American Cancer Society Study and Harvard Six-Cities Study, provide estimates of the relationship between pollution exposure and premature mortality <span id="id236">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1112" title="Elisabeth A.

The result is an estimate of the mortality risk per tonne of pollutant emitted in each U.S. county.
This marginal damage estimate can be aggregated to zonal resolution and multiplied by total emissions to estimate total mortality.</p>
<p>As a final step, annual premature deaths from air pollution can be translated into a monetary value by applying a value of a statistical life.
For this, ReEDS relies on EPA’s estimate of $7.4 million in $2006 <span id="id237">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id951" title="EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). Mortality Risk Valuation. April 2014.

These costs can then be translated into costs per unit of generation and cumulative (discounted) cost over the study period.</p>
<p>The approach described here focuses on direct emissions from the electric power sector and thus does not capture estimates from other sectors (such as transportation, buildings, and industry) or upstream emissions (such as from fossil fuel extraction or power plant manufacturing).
It also does not quantify any social costs of climate change from CO<sub>2</sub> or other greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

Specifically, the LCOE is calculated as follows <span id="id238">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1794" title="NREL. 2019 Annual Technology Baseline. Technical Report, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, 2019. URL: https://atb.nrel.gov/.">NREL, 2019</a>]</span>:</p>

<p>In each model year, ReEDS reports the LCOE for all technology options considering different variations in tax credit treatments and capacity factor assumptions.
ReEDS also calculates the LCOE for technologies that are built in this model year using the generation from these technologies.</p>
</section>
<section id="technology-value">
<h4>Technology value<a class="headerlink" href="#technology-value" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>ReEDS reports the value that generators receive from providing grid services.
Value is calculated as the product of service prices and service provision quantities.
For example, the value of a generator that comes from providing energy service to meet planning reserve margin requirement is calculated as the price of capacity multiplied by the amount of firm capacity the generator can provide.
The reported revenues capture energy, capacity, operating reserve, and state-level and national RPS requirements.
Revenues can be normalized either by the amount of generation or by the amount of installed capacity.</p>
<p>Revenues are closely related to, but are different from, the electricity price and service requirement quantity parameters.
Revenues consider the <em>provision</em> of different services from a certain generator in a region, whereas service requirement quantities calculate the <em>demand</em> of different services in a region.
The sum of revenues from all generating technologies in a specific region does not necessarily equal the sum of products of all service prices and corresponding service requirements.</p>

“Values” of a generator reflect the potential economic benefit from displacing or avoiding the cost of providing the services from other (marginal) assets, whereas “costs” aggregate all different sources of costs needed to build and operate a power plant to provide services.

<p>We report three types of such metrics to assess the economic viability of generators: net value of energy, net value of capacity, and system profitability metrics (<a class="reference internal" href="#net-value-metrics"><span class="std std-numref">Table 27</span></a>).
These metrics are reported both for new investments in a certain model year and for existing generators that have been built.</p>

<p>NVOE measures the unit profit of a specific technology, calculated as the difference between generator revenue and costs, then normalized by the energy production.
The typical unit is dollars per megawatt-hour ($/MWh).
Similarly, NVOC measures the unit profit of a specific technology, calculated as the difference between generator revenue and costs, then normalized by the installed capacity.
The typical unit is dollars per megawatt ($/MW).</p>
<p>Both of these metrics are normalized metrics; because the denominators vary broadly for different generator types, they may not reflect the competitiveness of technologies consistently.
Therefore, we report a third type of economic viability metric—system profitability metrics—which are essentially unitless functions of the ratio between values and costs.
Examples include profitability index (value/cost) and return on investment (value/cost minus one).
We report both metrics in ReEDS, acknowledging there are other formats of system profitability metrics.</p>
<p>These economic viability metrics help explain investment decisions in the model.
Specifically, for all types of new investment in a certain model year, the model considers all the costs to build and operate a certain technology as <em>costs</em> and the contribution of the technology to all binding constraints as <em>values</em> (i.e., service provision).
Typical value sources are discussed above in <a class="reference internal" href="#technology-value"><span class="xref myst">Technology Value</span></a>.
In calculations of economic viability metrics, however, other types of “values” are included to fully reflect model decisions.
For example, an increase in ancillary service requirements because of increased wind generation fraction is counted as a negative value stream for wind, and it is included in the metrics calculation here.
Therefore, these metrics fully reflect all the model constraints related to the investment decision.</p>

<p>The ReEDS reduced-form dispatch and variable renewable parameterization aims to represent enough operational detail for realistic capacity expansion decisions,
but the model cannot explicitly represent detailed power system operations.
To enable more detailed study of system operations, NREL has developed a translation framework <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NREL/R2X">R2X</a> to implement a ReEDS capacity
expansion solution for any solve year in production cost models (PCMs).
R2X supports translations to mainstream PCMs: Sienna and PLEXOS.

<p>The ReEDS-PCM linkage involves several transformations to the ReEDS solution to prepare it for use in the PCM.
These transformations include disaggregating the ReEDS solution and adding the necessary parameters for PCM.
To maintain consistency, the linkage preserves the spatial resolution of ReEDS (zone or county) and operates the PCM as a zonal model that matches ReEDS zones (or county) with a simplified transmission interface between them.
The PCM translation uses ReEDS transmission line capacity, whereas reactance and resistance are derived from ReEDS transmission properties to represent the aggregated transmission system.
For generating capacity, ReEDS aggregate capacity is converted to individual units in the PCM using characteristic unit sizes for each technology.
Where possible and reasonable, ReEDS cost and performance parameters are used, although these values can be improved if more data are available.
If a parameter is missing or inconsistently used in ReEDS because of structural differences between the models, the default translation uses average values across the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NREL/R2X/blob/main/src/r2x/defaults/pcm_defaults.json">WECC</a> for the equivalent technologies in ReEDS.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref63" id="id242" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>36<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>Once the ReEDS solution is converted to a PCM, one can simulate hourly dispatch over a full year and compare results with ReEDS outcomes.
A consistent solution builds confidence in the effectiveness of ReEDS capacity expansion decisions, whereas inconsistencies and reliability concerns such as load shedding indicate the need for improving capacity expansion model structures.

<h3>ReEDS-Cambium<a class="headerlink" href="#reeds-cambium" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Leveraging the capabilities of the ReEDS-PCM linkage, a third model—Cambium—has been developed.
Cambium draws from ReEDS and PLEXOS model solutions to assemble a structured database of hourly cost and operational data for modeled futures of the U.S. electric sector.
In addition to directly reporting some metrics from both ReEDS and PLEXOS (e.g., capacity buildouts from ReEDS and generation by technology from PLEXOS),
Cambium postprocesses the outputs from both models to develop new metrics that are designed to be useful for long-term decision making,
such as a long-run marginal emission rate.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref64" id="id244" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>37<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>Datasets derived through Cambium can be viewed and downloaded at <a class="reference external" href="https://cambium.nrel.gov/">https://cambium.nrel.gov/</a>.

<h3>ReEDS-reV<a class="headerlink" href="#reeds-rev" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The ReEDS supply curve for renewable technologies, including land-based wind, CSP, utility-scale PV, and geothermal are produced by reV.
The ReEDS-reV linkage allows regional ReEDS investment decisions to be mapped backed to individual reV supply curve sites.
Site-specific supply curve data from reV are binned for the ReEDS supply curve by default into 5–40 bins depending on the resource type (see <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numbins_{technology}</span></code> in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cases.csv</span></code>).
By tracking the timing and investment decisions within each of these bins, the ReEDS-reV linkage maps regional capacity back to the individual sites from which the bins were derived.
The resulting siting data are used to further the understanding of the ReEDS capacity expansion decisions and identify areas for improvement for resource siting in reV.
The ReEDS-reV linkage is a key component in the translation of ReEDS capacity expansion results to a nodal production cost modeling database.</p>

<h3>Natural Gas Supply Curves<a class="headerlink" href="#natural-gas-supply-curves" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The ReEDS model does not explicitly model the U.S. natural gas (NG) system, which involves multiple sectors of the economy and includes complex infrastructure and markets.
Rather, a regional supply curve representation is used to approximate the NG system as it interacts with the electric sector.
For more information on the impact of natural gas representation in ReEDS, see <span id="id2397">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id650" title="Wesley J. Cole, Kenneth B. Medlock III, and Aditya Jani. A view to the future of natural gas and electricity: An integrated modeling approach. Energy Economics, 2016. URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988316300433 (visited on 2016-11-16), doi:10.1016/j.eneco.2016.03.005.">Cole <em>et al.</em>, 2016</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The premise of using regional supply curves is the price in each region will be a function of both the regional and national NG demand.
The supply curves are parameterized from AEO scenarios for each of the nine EIA census divisions (shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-hierarchy"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 17</span></a>).
Two methods exist to parameterize the natural gas supply curves; both are discussed here.
The first method, which involves estimating a linear regression of prices on regional and national quantities, has been used in a previous version of ReEDS and is discussed first.
The second method is relatively new to ReEDS and involves parameterizing a constant elasticity of supply curve and is discussed second.
Through multiple tests, we have found minimal differences in results between the two versions (1% or less of a change in national generation by technology).</p>
<div class="admonition-natural-gas-price-inputs admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Natural Gas Price Inputs</p>
<p>Natural gas price and demand inputs can be found in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inputs/fuelprices</span></code>, and natural gas price inputs are controlled by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ngscen</span></code> switch in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cases.csv</span></code>.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_GasCurve</span></code> determines which type of natural gas supply curve is used in the model (see the description for the switch in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cases.csv</span></code>).
When performing ReEDS runs at less than national scale, setting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_GasCurve</span></code> to option 2 (static natural gas prices) is required.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Linear Regression Approach</strong></p>
<p>The AEO scenarios were used to estimate parameters for the following NG price-consumption model:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-ng-price-consumption">
<span class="eqno">(1)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-ng-price-consumption" title="Link to this equation"></a></span>\[P_{r,t} = \alpha + \alpha_r + \alpha_t + \alpha_{r,t} + \beta_{\text{nat}}Q_{\text{nat},t} + \beta_rQ_{r,t}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_{r,t}\)</span> is the price of natural gas (in $/MMBtu) in region <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> and year <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>; the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> parameters are the intercept terms of the supply curves with adjustments made based on region (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha_r\)</span>), year (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha_t\)</span>), and the region-year interaction (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha_{r,t}\)</span>); <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_{\text{nat}}\)</span> is the coefficient for the national NG demand (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{\text{nat}}\)</span>, in quads); and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_r\)</span> is the coefficient for the regional NG demand (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{r,t}\)</span>) in region <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>.
Note the four <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> parameters in <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-ng-price-consumption">(1)</a> can in practice be represented using only <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha_{r,t}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> terms are regressed from AEO2014 scenarios, with 9 of the 31 AEO2014 scenarios removed as outliers <span id="id2398">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id845" title="EIA. Annual Energy Outlook 2014. Technical Report DOE/EIA-0383(2014), U.S. DOE Energy Information Administration, Washington, D.C., 2014.">EIA, 2014</a>]</span>.
These outlier scenarios typically include cases of very low or very high natural gas resource availability, which are useful for estimating NG price as a function of supply but not for estimating NG price as a function of demand—for given supply scenarios.
The national and regional <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> terms are reported in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-census-division-values"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 61</span></a>.
We made a specific post hoc adjustment to the regression model’s outputs for one region: The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_r\)</span> term for the West North Central division was originally an order of magnitude higher than the other <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_r\)</span> values because the West North Central usage in the electricity sector is so low (0.05 quad<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref65" id="id2399" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>38<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> in 2013, compared to ~0.5 quad or more in most regions).
The overall natural gas usage (i.e., not just electricity sector usage) in West North Central is similar to the usage in East North Central, so intuitively it makes sense to have a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_r\)</span> for West North Central relatively close to that of East North Central.
We therefore manually adjusted the West North Central <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_r\)</span> term to be 0.6 (in 2004$/MMBtu/quad) and recalculated the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> terms with the new <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> to achieve the AEO2014 target prices.
The situation in West North Central whereby such a small fraction of NG demand goes to electricity is unique; we do not believe the other regions warrant similar treatment.</p>

<p>The “National” value at the far left is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_{\text{nat}}\)</span>.
A <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> of 0.2 means if demand increases by 1 quad, the price will increase by $0.20/MMBtu (see <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-ng-price-consumption">(1)</a>).</p>
<p>The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> terms are then regressed for each scenario assuming the same <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> values for all scenarios.

<p><strong>Comparison of Elasticities From Regression Approach to Literature Values</strong></p>
<p>Technical literature tends to report the price elasticity of supply and the price elasticity of demand, which are estimates of the supply and demand, respectively, of a good given a change in price.
In the formulation given by <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-ng-price-consumption">(1)</a>, we attempt to estimate a value that is similar to the price elasticity of demand—we estimate a change in price given a change in demand.
Therefore, we present here a comparison against the price elasticity of demand as the closest available proxy, noting it is not necessarily identical to estimates of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span>.
Price elasticity of demand is typically negative but is reported here as a positive number for convenience.</p>
<p>External sources are varied and often vague in their estimates of price sensitivity of natural gas.
Using the reported domestic NG market demand given for 2012 in AEO2014, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> values reported here yield an overall NG sector elasticity value of 0.36–0.92 (higher values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> correspond to lower elasticity values).

<p><strong>Constant Elasticity of Supply</strong></p>
<p>The second method for representing gas price adjustments leverages a constant elasticity of supply curve for census division prices as a function of the quantities consumed.
The general form of the equation relies on a reference price (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{p}\)</span>), a reference quantity (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{q}\)</span>), and a price elasticity of supply (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon\)</span>)<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref66" id="id2405" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>39<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> to determine the endogenous price (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>) based on an endogenous quantity (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>) so:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[p = \overline{p}\left( \frac{q}{\overline{q}} \right)^{\epsilon}\]</div>
<p>When parameterizing for the census division representations, the supply curve should reflect the change in price given a change in the census division’s quantity consumed in the electricity sector.
To the best of our knowledge, no published studies estimate the elasticity of supply for natural gas specific to each sector and region.
Therefore, the calibrated curve must consider the change in the census division’s price given a change in the consumption of natural gas in the region’s electricity sector with respect to other regions and sectors.
To do this, the reference price, numerator, and denominator in the previous equation are adjusted to reflect the consumption change only in the electricity sector.
Explicitly, the constant elasticity of supply parameters are now indexed by census division (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>) and sector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s \in \{ electricity,\ \ industrial,\ \ residential,\ \ commercial,\ \ vehicles\}\)</span>).
The equation used to populate the supply curve in the model becomes:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[p_{ele,r} = {\overline{p}}_{ele,r}\left( \frac{\sum_{s^{'} \notin ele,r^{'} \notin r}^{}{\overline{q}}_{s^{'},r^{'}} + q_{ele,r}}{\sum_{s,r}^{}{\overline{q}}_{s,r}} \right)^{\epsilon}\]</div>
<p>A potential addition to this representation, included as a switch in the model, also includes national price adjustments as deviations from the reference point.
By denoting the national price as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{ele,nat}\)</span>, the deviation from the benchmark price based on national quantities consumed in the electricity sector can be computed as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta p_{ele,nat} = {\overline{p}}_{ele,nat}\left( 1 - \frac{\sum_{s^{'} \notin ele,r}^{}{{\overline{q}}_{s^{'},r} + \sum_{r}^{}q_{ele,r}}}{\sum_{s,r}^{}{\overline{q}}_{s,r}} \right)^{\epsilon}\]</div>

<p>Define the interest payment (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span>) in year <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> as a function of the total payment (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\text{TotalPayment}\)</span>) and the principal payment (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span>):</p>

<p><strong>Financing Multiplier:</strong> The financing multiplier (not to be confused with the financial multiplier) is an adjustment to reflect either higher or lower returns to capital, relative to the systemwide average return to capital.
Conceptually, it is a multiplier that reflects the total present value of a stream of higher (or lower) payments to capital, relative to what the payments would be at the system’s average cost of capital.
For example, if a technology’s weighted average cost of capital (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\text{WACC}_\text{tech}\)</span>) is 7% and the systemwide WACC is 5% (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\text{WACC}_\text{sys}\)</span>),
and the technology is being evaluated for a 20-year horizon (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(l\)</span>) at a real discount rate of 5% (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_r\)</span>),
the financing multiplier (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\text{FinancingMult}\)</span>) would be 1.25, according to the equation below.
This multiplier represents that the total present value of the returns to capital for this technology must be higher (by an amount equal to 25% of the initial investment), relative to a technology with average financing terms.
The difference in the technology WACC and systemwide WACC represents the difference in returns to capital because of diversifiable risk.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\text{FinancingMult} = 1 + \left(\text{WACC}_\text{tech} - \text{WACC}_\text{sys}\right) \cdot \frac{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + d_r\right)^l}}{d_r}\]</div>
<p>To derive the above equation, begin with the definition of the capital recovery factor (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\text{CRF}\)</span>) for real discount rate (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_r\)</span>) and economic horizon (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(l\)</span>):</p>

\[\text{CRF} = \frac{\text{Annuity}}{\text{Present Value of Annuity}} = \frac{d_r}{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + d_r\right)^l}}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\text{Present Value of Annuity} = \frac{1}{\text{CRF}} \cdot \text{Annuity}\]</div>
<p>Therefore, for every dollar invested in a technology, the absolute difference in required return is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta_\text{Returns}^\text{Absolute} = \$1 \cdot \text{WACC}_\text{tech} \cdot \frac{1}{\text{CRF}} - \$1 \cdot \text{WACC}_\text{sys} \cdot \frac{1}{\text{CRF}}\]</div>
<p>Finally, the relative difference in required return per dollar invested is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta_\text{Returns}^\text{Relative} = \frac{\$1 + \Delta}{\$1} = 1 + \Delta\]</div>
<p><strong>Depreciation Expense:</strong> The present value of depreciation (PVdepr) expense is computed based on the fraction of the plant value that is depreciable in each year.
All investments use a MACRS depreciation schedule with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_t^\text{depr}\)</span> representing deprecation fraction in year <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>.
This depreciation is sheltered from taxes, which is reflected by the term <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 - T \cdot \text{PresentValueDepr}\)</span> in the financial multiplier equation above.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\text{PresentValueDepr} = \sum_t{\frac{1}{\left(1 + d_n\right)^t} \cdot f_t^\text{depr}}\]</div>
<p><strong>Depreciable Basis:</strong> The eligible cost basis for MACRS depreciation expense is reduced by one-half the effective value of the tax credit:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\text{PresentValueDepr} \left(1 - \frac{\text{ITC}_\text{eff}}{2} \right)\]</div>
<p><strong>Investment Tax Credit:</strong> The value of the ITC is reduced to reflect the costs of monetizing it (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m_\text{ITC}\)</span>).
The effective investment tax credit value (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({ITC}_{eff}\)</span>) reduces the tax burden of the investments.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\text{ITC}_\text{eff} = \text{ITC} \cdot m_\text{ITC}\]</div>
<p><strong>Taxes:</strong> The denominator term of the financial multiplier equation (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1-T\)</span>) reflects the additional revenues necessary to pay taxes.
The tax burden is adjusted for depreciation expenses as well as the effective investment tax credit.</p>
<p><strong>Weighted Average Cost of Capital:</strong> The technology-agnostic nominal discount rate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_n\)</span> is represented as the average WACC

<h3>Interday Storage Operation<a class="headerlink" href="#interday-storage-operation" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Interday linkage must be established for LDES.
Simulating LDES requires interperiod linkage to reflect seasonal SOC changes.
This can be achieved by using a fully chronological year at hourly resolution with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_HourlyType</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">'year'</span></code>, but this approach is computationally intensive.
Alternatively, ReEDS offers an interday linkage option that enables SOC linkage across representative days while maintaining high computational efficiency.
This interday linkage can be activated using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_InterDayLinkage</span></code>, which is designed to work with the representative day and week method (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GSw_HourlyType</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">'day'</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">'wek'</span></code>).
Currently, interday linkage is supported for batteries with durations of 12, 24, 48, 72, and 100 hours.
Without the interday linkage, SOC is typically limited to intraday changes and resets at the end of each representative period, preventing interperiod variations.
However, with interday linkage enabled, SOC can evolve across multiple periods, with fidelity improving as the number of representative periods increases, as demonstrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-sparse-chronology"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 64</span></a>.
The interday linkage is built using a sparse chronology strategy—a recently developed method that is computationally efficient and accurate—as referenced in <span id="id2407">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id573" title="Yunzhi Chen, Brian Sergi, Jonathan Ho, Gord Stephen, Wesley Cole, and Kody M.

<h3>Storage Capacity Credit<a class="headerlink" href="#storage-capacity-credit" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Resource adequacy modeling in ReEDS uses the <a class="reference internal" href="#stress-periods-ra-method"><span class="xref myst">stress periods</span></a> approach by default, which uses the same model for storage as described in the <a class="reference internal" href="#temporal-resolution"><span class="xref myst">temporal resolution</span></a> section.
Here the treatment of storage under the alternative <a class="reference internal" href="#capacity-credit-ra-method"><span class="xref myst">capacity credit</span></a> method is described.</p>
<p>The storage capacity credit method characterizes the increase in storage duration that is needed to serve peak demand as a function of total storage capacity.
The potential of storage to serve peak demand is considered by performing several simulated dispatches against the load profiles within each of the resource assessment regions.
Net load profiles of wind and PV generation are used to capture the effects of VRE resources on the overall net load profile shape in a region using the hourly load, wind, and solar profiles.</p>
<p>For each season and reliability assessment zone, storage dispatch is simulated with peaking capacity prioritized over all other services (reflecting capacity market prioritization as discussed by <span id="id2408">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id2067" title="Ramteen Sioshansi, Seyed Hossein Madaeni, and Paul Denholm. A Dynamic Programming Approach to Estimate the Capacity Value of Energy Storage. IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 29(1):395–403, January 2014. URL: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6601729/, doi:10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2279839.">Sioshansi <em>et al.</em>, 2014</a>]</span>).
Transmission constraints are ignored within each reliability assessment zone;
this copper plate transmission assumption applies only to the capacity credit calculation—all transmission constraints are enforced in the actual planning reserve margin constraint and other system planning and operation modeling in ReEDS.
Optimal coordination of dispatch among energy storage resources is also assumed.
The transmission and coordination assumptions together allow for all storage within a reliability assessment zone to be represented as a single aggregate resource.
The round-trip efficiency of this aggregated storage resource is assumed to be equal to the energy-capacity-weighted average round-trip efficiency of all installed storage capacity in that region.</p>
<p>Round-trip efficiency losses are included in storage charging.
For example, a storage resource with a round-trip efficiency of 85% and a power capacity of 10,000 MW can dispatch 10,000 MW to the grid for 1 hour using 10,000 MWh of energy capacity.
However, when the same resource draws 10,000 MW from the grid for 1 hour, its SOC increases by only 8,500 MWh.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#figure-energy-capacity-requirements-for-storage"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 65</span></a> illustrates the dispatch and calculation of the energy requirement for 5,000 MW of storage to receive full capacity credit in the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) region in 2020.
First, the storage power capacity is subtracted from the peak load to set a net load maximum.
Storage is required to discharge whenever the load profile exceeds this maximum to ensure the peak net load (load minus storage, in this example) is equal to the peak load minus the power capacity of the storage device.
The storage is allowed to charge at all other times while ensuring the load maximum is not exceeded.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This dispatch is then used to calculate the energy requirement for storage to receive full capacity credit.
At the beginning of the season, the SOC of storage within the region is assumed to be full.
The state of charge (or depth of discharge, as is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-energy-capacity-requirements-for-storage"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 65</span></a>) is tracked over the course of the time series with the maximum depth of discharge left unconstrained.
This means the maximum depth of discharge value over the course of the season is equal to the amount of energy capacity that is needed for storage to receive full capacity credit.
Dividing this energy by the power capacity used produces the minimum fleetwide average duration (hours) for storage to receive full capacity credit.
In the example in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-energy-capacity-requirements-for-storage"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 65</span></a>, 5,000 MW of peak demand reduction from storage would require 47,000 MWh of energy to receive full capacity credit, or a duration of 9.4 hours.</p>
<p>We repeat this process in each region for each season over a large range of storage power capacities (from 0% to 90% of peak demand in 100-MW increments).
The result of each dispatch is used to produce the “power-energy curve” in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-storage-peak-capacity-determination"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 66</span></a>, which allows us to calculate the marginal capacity credit for additional storage.
The curve gives storage energy capacity that is required for full capacity credit as a function of total storage capacity.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref45" id="id2409" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>40<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>
At any point along the curve, the slope of the tangent to the curve represents the number of hours needed for marginal storage to receive full capacity credit.
The incremental capacity credit of an additional unit of storage is equal to the duration of the additional unit installed divided by the duration requirement (slope) at the point on the curve corresponding to the installed storage capacity.</p>

Note these capacities are cumulative, starting from the shortest duration and moving to the longest.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#figure-storage-peak-capacity-determination" title="Link to this image"></a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#figure-storage-peak-capacity-determination"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 66</span></a> also illustrates how we create a more tractable solution by reducing the number of combinations considered.
Storage in ReEDS is considered in several discrete durations, which are used to define the requirements needed to receive full capacity credit.
Instead of a continuous function represented by the constantly varying slope of the power-energy curve, we create several discrete peak duration “bins” representing duration requirements.
We start by plotting a line with constant slope equal to the shortest duration considered and find where it intersects with the power-energy curve.
Then, starting from that point, we plot a line with the next shortest duration and find the point where it intersects with the power-energy curve, and so on, until we have obtained the cumulative limit for each discrete duration of storage to serve peak demand.</p>
<p>As an example, the first segment (having a slope of 2) requires 2 hours to provide full capacity credit, even though it may be physically possible for some small amount of storage with a duration less than 2 hours to receive full capacity credit.
In this example, at the point where 4,309 MW of 2-hour storage has been added, the lines intersect and the interpolation shifts to a slope of 4 hours, so a device with 4 hours is now required to achieve full capacity credit.
The model is still allowed to build 2 hours of storage, but it will receive only a 50% (2/4) capacity credit—or the duration of the installed storage device divided by the discrete peak duration “bin.”
At each point, the marginal capacity credit is calculated by the physical capacity of the incremental unit, divided by the discrete duration requirement slope at any point along the curve.</p>
<p>The limit for each duration to serve peak demand from <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-storage-peak-capacity-determination"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 66</span></a> is passed back to the ReEDS model, and the model optimizes the capacity credit of all storage (existing and new investments) together.
One advantage of this approach is that it informs the model of when the capacity credit of storage should go up or down in response to changes in the net load profile shape.
Another advantage is that total storage peaking capacity can be assessed in conjunction with other services storage can provide such as curtailment recovery, energy arbitrage, and operating reserves<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ref46" id="id2410" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>41<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>, and a least-cost solution can be obtained overall.</p>
<p>This dynamic assessment of storage capacity credit enables the model to identify the limitations of energy storage to provide peaking capacity.
It allows the model to identify the benefits, if they exist, of deploying short-duration resources at reduced capacity credit for energy arbitrage purposes or other grid services captured in the model.
Alternatively, the model is also free to deploy longer-duration storage even when shorter durations would receive full capacity credit if this leads to a least-cost solution for meeting all grid services.
It also allows the model to respond to changes in net load shape from wind and PV deployment.
The capacity credit of storage can change from one solve year to the next as a result of these net load profile shape changes.</p>
<p>Peaking capacity potential for longer durations of storage are also assessed within the model.
The potential for 12- and 24-hour storage is included in the assessments described in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-energy-capacity-requirements-for-storage"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 65</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-storage-peak-capacity-determination"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 66</span></a>.
This is meant to accommodate the potential to derate the capacity credit of 10-hour batteries and capture the capacity credit of PSH (assumed to have an 8-hour duration by default) and compressed air energy storage (assumed to have a 12-hour duration).</p>
<p>After this potential is determined, the actual storage capacity credit in ReEDS is determined within the optimization.
The durations of storage devices that are installed by the model are evaluated based on the peaking capacity potential of storage (<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-energy-capacity-requirements-for-storage"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 65</span></a>).
The constraints for the formulation of storage capacity credit in ReEDS are as follows:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\sum_{pd}^{}{C_{pd,id} = C_{id}}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\sum_{id}^{}{C_{pd,id}*{cc}_{pd,id} \leq L_{pd}}\]</div>
<p>where <em>L</em> is the limit of peaking storage capacity (i.e., the megawatt values from Figure 5), <em>C</em> is the installed storage capacity, <em>id</em> is the duration of installed storage, <em>pd</em> is the duration of the peak demand contribution being considered, and <em>cc</em> is the capacity credit of an installed duration (<em>id</em>) of storage when applied to a specific peaking duration (<em>pd</em>).
Storage capacity credit is equal to installed duration / peak duration, with a maximum of 1.
For each duration of installed storage <em>id</em>, its capacity can contribute to any duration of peak demand <em>pd</em>, but the total installed storage capacity <em>C<sub>id</sub></em> must be equal to the sum of its contributions toward each duration of peak demand.
And for each duration of peak demand <em>pd</em>, the total contribution of each installed duration <em>id</em> of storage capacity (adjusted for their capacity credit <em>cc</em>) cannot exceed the limit of peaking storage capacity <em>L</em> of that <em>pd</em>.</p>
<p>For example, consider a simple example where there is 100 MW of peaking storage potential for each storage duration considered in ReEDS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours.
In this example, 200 MW of 2-hour storage, 100 MW of 4-hour storage, and 50 MW of 6-hour storage are already installed.
The model would optimize the capacity credit of storage by giving 100 MW of 2-hour storage full capacity credit for its 2-hour contribution, the 100 MW of 4-hour storage full capacity credit for its 4-hour contribution, and the 50 MW of 6-hour storage full capacity credit for its 6-hour contribution (<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-storage-capacity-credit-allocation-example"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 67</span></a>).
In this example, the peaking potential limits of 2- and 4-hour storage have been reached, so the remaining 100 MW of 2-hour storage would receive a capacity credit of 1/3 and contribute 33.3 MW for its 6-hour peak demand contribution.
The model could then build 16.7 MW of 6-hour storage at full capacity credit, at which point the potential for 6-hour storage to meet peak demand would be reached as well.
The model would then be able to build 2-, 4-, or 6-hour storage at a derated capacity credit with their contribution going toward the 8-hour peak demand “bin,” or it could build 8-hour storage with full capacity credit.</p>

<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 67 </span><span class="caption-text">An example of storage capacity credit allocation in ReEDS.
200 MW of 2-hour batteries exist, but there is only 100 MW of 2-hour peaking capacity potential.
Because there is also 100 MW of 4-hour batteries serving all 100 MW of 4-hour peaking storage potential, the remaining 100 MW of 2-hour storage provides 33.3 MW toward the 6-hour peaking storage potential.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#figure-storage-capacity-credit-allocation-example" title="Link to this image"></a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now consider the same example but in addition to the 2-, 4-, and 6-hour storage installed, there is also 300 MW of PSH in this region with a 12-hour duration (<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-storage-capacity-credit-allocation-example2"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 68</span></a>).
The potential for 12-hour storage to serve peak demand is only 100 MW.
Rather than giving the remaining 200 MW of PSH a capacity credit of 1/2 for its contribution to the 24-hour peak demand period, it is optimal for the model to fill the 10- and 8-hour peak demand “bins” with the remaining PSH capacity at full capacity credit because no other storage is allocated to those peak demand periods.
Now, after the model builds 16.7 MW of 6-hour storage at full capacity credit, the 8-, 10-, and 12-hour bins are already filled by PSH.
So, if the model wants to build additional storage capacity, it will shuffle the allocated storage capacity to the optimal “bins” as it fills the 24-hour bin.
In this example, if any 8-hour storage is built, it will be allocated to the 8-hour bin, and some PSH capacity will be pushed out of that bin and reallocated to the 24-hour bin at 1/2 capacity credit (12 hours / 24 hours).
So, even though the duration required for storage to receive full capacity credit at this point is 24 hours, 8-hour storage would receive a marginal capacity credit of 1/2 because an excess of 12-hour storage is already installed in the system.</p>

<p>Storage capacity credit is sensitive to a variety of factors on the power system, so, rather than ignoring the many factors that can influence storage capacity credit, we simply pass the model information on what storage <em>could</em> do to serve peaking capacity based on load shape and storage duration and then allow the model to choose the least-cost option based on the suite of available resources and the entire set of storage revenue streams represented within the ReEDS model.

Depending on the needs of the user, different spatial resolutions can also be used.
The default zones can be aggregated into larger regions,
or collections of zones can be disaggregated into their constituent counties (<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-counties"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 69</span></a>).
National-scale county-level resolution runs are extremely computationally intensive and require simplifications in other aspects of the model (e.g., fewer time steps, solve years, or technologies) to be able to produce a solution—even with simplifications, hundreds of gigabytes of memory are required to process the county-level inputs.
Runs that aggregate zones across state boundaries require state policies be turned off because the model does not have any built-in features for aggregating state policies for states that have been combined.</p>

<p>The spatial framework built into the ReEDS model allows other spatial resolutions;

<p>The model also has the capability to use mixed resolutions.
For example, California can be represented using the default model zones, whereas the rest of the United States is represented at state resolution.
This can enable finer detail for a specific region of interest while capturing trades with neighboring regions as lower resolution but with a reasonable solution time.</p>

Nodes from the dataset are spatially matched to counties using nodal coordinates and a shapefile of U.S. counties (described below).
With this dataset, there are a few dozen counties that have no transmission nodes or capacity, which may be the result of missing data.
To address this, nodes and lines are added to ensure every county has at least one transmission interface.
This is done by either adding a node on existing lines that cross a county but previously had nodes in that county, or, if there are no transiting lines, adding a node to the county centroid and matching to the closest node in a neighboring county.</p>

<p>Power flow constraints imposed by the topology of the network can limit the true transfer capacity between two counties to a level below the physical capacity of the lines connecting those counties.

Because interface limits are typically less influenced by parts of the network that are farther away, the method is run on a subset of the network.
This subset is selected by including all parts of the network that are a specified number of “hops” away from the interface being optimized.
A comparison of the results from the optimization method with different hops found total transfer capacity saturated after six hops, so this value was used when calculating the county-level transfer limits used in ReEDS.
Because the transfer capacity can differ depending on the direction, the optimization is run once in each direction (forward and reverse) for each interface.

<p>After the optimization, some counties have zero transfer capacity in one or both directions; these are replaced with either the transfer capacity estimated in the other direction if it is nonzero or with the thermal capacity of the line.
To estimate metrics such as TW-mi of transfer capacity, ReEDS uses the distance between the centroids of the two counties in the interface.

<h4>Wind and solar supply curve data<a class="headerlink" href="#wind-and-solar-supply-curve-data" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Supply curves for wind and solar are based on data from the reV model, which provides total resource potential, representative resource profiles, and any location-dependent supply curve costs <span id="id2416">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1567" title="Galen Maclaurin, Nick Grue, Anthony Lopez, Dona Heimiller, Michael Rossol, Grant Buster, and Travis Williams.

Each supply curve point from the reV model is mapped directly to its corresponding county.
These supply curve points are then aggregated by ReEDS to produce county-level supply curves.</p>
<p>The reV model includes estimates of the cost of investments needed to reinforce the transmission network with the addition of more wind and solar.
For the ReEDS zonal spatial representation, these network reinforcement costs are calculated by determining the least-cost interconnection point and then estimating the transmission upgrades needed between that point and the zone’s network node.
Because the county-level resolution now explicitly represents transmission investments between counties, the network reinforcement costs from reV are not included in the transmission cost estimates of the county supply curves.
Spur line costs, or the cost to build from the resource site to the interconnection point, are still taken from reV.
In the future, the reV model may be adapted to produce network reinforcement costs at the county level, although they might be sufficiently small that ignoring them would be appropriate.</p>

The power plants in this database include latitude and longitude to give their location.
These locations are mapped to counties to provide the county assignment for the power plants.
In a few isolated cases, hydropower units that were on a county boundary were manually assigned to a county to better align with the jurisdiction that operates that plant.
For example, the Columbia River serves as a boundary line for several counties, and hydropower plants on the Columbia were assigned to the county’s public utility district that owns and operates that dam rather than to the county that mapped to the specific latitude and longitude value.</p>

<h4>Shapefiles<a class="headerlink" href="#shapefiles" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Matching transmission nodes to counties and plotting maps of county-level results requires shapefiles of U.S. counties.

<h4>Scaling datasets to county resolution<a class="headerlink" href="#scaling-datasets-to-county-resolution" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>All datasets besides those described above were downscaled from 134-zone resolution to county-level resolution using one of the following five methods.</p>
<p><strong>Uniform disaggregation:</strong></p>
<p>All counties within a model zone are assigned the same value as the one used for the zone.</p>
<p><strong>Downscaling based on population:</strong></p>
<p>The “population” disaggregation method uses population fractions as multipliers to calculate county-level data from zonal inputs.
The multipliers used in this method represent the fraction of a county’s population with respect to its corresponding ReEDS zone.
Population data used to create the multipliers are sourced from the 2021 Population Totals dataset provided by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Example data for ReEDS Zones p29 and p30 are shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#population-fraction-ex-data"><span class="std std-numref">Table 28</span></a>.</p>

<p>Because only one county exists in ReEDS Zone “p29,” the population fraction for that county is 1.
On the other hand, two counties exist in ReEDS Zone “p30”: The population fractions show 95.6% of the population of p30 lives in County p04019, whereas 4.4% of the population lives in p04023.
To disaggregate by population, the dataset is mapped to zonal ReEDS input data and the population fraction is multiplied by the values of the zonal-level dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Downscaling based on geographic size:</strong></p>
<p>The geographic size disaggregation method operates similarly to the “population” disaggregation method but instead uses the fraction of a county’s geographic area with respect to its corresponding ReEDS zone as fractional multipliers for downscaling zonal input data to county level.
Geographic area data used to create the multipliers are sourced from the 2022 TIGER/Line U.S. County Shapefile provided by the U.S. Census Bureau and found in the inputs folder of the ReEDS repository.</p>
<p><strong>Downscaling based on existing hydropower capacity:</strong></p>
<p>The existing hydropower disaggregation method uses the fraction of existing hydropower capacity in a given county with respect to the total hydropower capacity of the county’s corresponding ReEDS zone as fractional multipliers for downscaling zonal input data to county level.
Existing hydropower capacity data used to calculate these fractional multipliers are sourced from the EIA-NEMS generator database included in the ReEDS inputs.
This downscaling method is used for hydropower-specific data, such as hydropower upgrades.</p>
<p><strong>Downscaling based on transmission line size:</strong></p>
<p>Fractional multipliers used in the transmission line size disaggregation method represent the ratio of transmission capacity between a given U.S. county and a Canadian zone in relation to the total transmission capacity of the county’s corresponding U.S. zone.
For example, if U.S. Zone p1 comprises 2 counties, and 300 MW of transmission capacity exists between County 1 and the Canadian zone and 100 MW of transmission capacity exists between County 2 and the Canadian zone, the ratio of 3/4 (0.75) is used to disaggregate data between County 1 and the Canadian zone whereas a ratio of 1/4 (0.25) is used to disaggregate data between County 2 and the Canadian zone.
Transmission data used to create these multipliers are sourced from the same nodal dataset used to create the transmission interface limits described above.
Note transmission lines found in the source data are considered bidirectional; therefore, when calculating the total transmission capacity between a U.S. zone and Canadian zone, both directions must be considered.
This downscaling method is applied to Canadian import and export inputs.</p>
<p>We selected one of the five downscaling methods above for each of the inputs that included a spatial dimension.
The choice was made using analyst judgment.
In the input structure of ReEDS, if an appropriate county-level dataset becomes available, it can be used in place of the downscaled dataset.</p>
</section>
<section id="input-data-handling">
<h4>Input data handling<a class="headerlink" href="#input-data-handling" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Because some input data are specified at both zonal and county resolution, the inputs used for a given run will depend on the spatial resolution selected for that run.
The input scripts include logic that will read in the file with the appropriate spatial resolution and use that for the remainder of the run.
In the case of mixed resolutions, both files will be read in, and the appropriate regions will be concatenated to create a single input file with the specified spatial resolutions.</p>
<p>ReEDS has been set up to run so only data for the regions being modeled will be included in the model.
For example, if doing a run that includes only the state of North Dakota, the inputs processing step of ReEDS will filter all input data to include only the data for North Dakota.</p>
<p>Spatial datasets are dynamic within the model itself, so the model is agnostic to the region names.</p>
</section>
<section id="challenges-and-benefits-of-enhanced-spatial-resolution">
<h4>Challenges and benefits of enhanced spatial resolution<a class="headerlink" href="#challenges-and-benefits-of-enhanced-spatial-resolution" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>The greater spatial resolution available in ReEDS with county-level inputs creates a variety of opportunities to apply the ReEDS model to answer questions.
It enables specific regions of the country to be captured to greater resolution, enabling more granular outputs of power plant siting, transmission expansion, and emission impacts.
The higher resolution can also highlight key regional boundaries or interfaces that might not have been present in a lower-resolution model run.
Our testing has also shown county-level resolution can lead to better estimates of curtailment because there is more detail on the underlying transmission system.</p>
<p>The enhanced spatial resolution also comes with a variety of challenges.
These include runtime, especially as the number of regions considered grows.
Much of our testing showed a tenfold increase in the number of regions led to at least a tenfold increase in solve time, although runtime ultimately depends on the machine specifications and the model options selected for that particular run.
Another major challenge is sourcing appropriate input data.
If the downscaling methods described above are not suitable to answer the questions of a particular analysis, new data will need to be procured.
In addition, even the best transmission datasets we had available still had omissions, so it is unclear whether key data will be missing for studying a particular region.</p>
<p>Finally, enhanced spatial resolution can lead to false precision, where users see model solutions at high spatial resolution and put more stock into that model solution than is warranted because of uncertainty in the data or methods used.
For example, <span id="id2419">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id1642" title="Mahdi Mehrtash, Benjamin F. Hobbs, Reza Mahroo, and Yankai Cao.

<p>The PV reserve requirement is valid only during daytime hours when the PV systems are operating.
In addition, the requirement is a function of capacity rather than generation because reserves are especially important around sunrise and sunset when PV generation is low.</p>

<p>To provide ReEDS with foresight about these fossil phaseouts, we implement an increasing capital cost financing multiplier to plants that are being phased out.
This multiplier shortens the cost recovery period of the plant.
For example, when evaluating whether to build a gas-CC unit 5 years before the scheduled phaseout, the financial multiplier for gas-CC includes a 5-year cost recovery period.</p>

<p>Minimum load is an example of one such parameter.
The aggregate representation of minimum load in ReEDS at the technology-zone level does not effectively reflect unit-level operating constraints used in PLEXOS, so PLEXOS uses native assumptions for minimum load.</p>

<p>The long-run marginal emission rate is a metric designed to help estimate the emissions induced (or avoided) by a persistent change in electricity consumption.
Unlike the short-run marginal emission rate, the long-run marginal emission rate reflects the structural changes to the grid that can be induced by a persistent change in electricity consumption.</p>

<p>To account for forecasting errors and uncertainty in future loads, this curve is shifted by 1 hour of storage duration.
Thus, 2-hour storage gets full capacity credit for meeting peaks that are 1 hour in duration, 4-hour storage gets full capacity credit for peaks that are 3 hours or shorter, etc.</p>

<p>It is worth noting storage resources can provide resources to the electricity grid beyond peaking capacity and energy arbitrage.
A capacity expansion model such as ReEDS has limited representation of these services, but to the extent that they are represented in the model these services are captured when assessing energy storage.
