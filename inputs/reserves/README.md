# Input files
* `peak_net_imports.csv`: 99.9th percentile coincident transfers (BA-level, aggregated to NERC region-level) between 2019-2023 from EIA Hourly Grid Monitor used as an estimate of current interregional transfer capabilities, as tabulated in https://www.esig.energy/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ESIG-Interregional-Transmission-Resilience-methodology-report-2024.pdf. Values for SERC-E/SE/C calculated using ESIG 2024 methodology. The same 0.1% definition has been used elsewhere, e.g. https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2827/text#id6543a3657b784ecbb9362b629a5290ea. Values for MW_TotalDemand are for 2024 from LTRA 2023 (https://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/ra/Reliability%20Assessments%20DL/NERC_LTRA_2023.pdf) and represent on-peak projections (same as used in  NERC planning reserve margin calculations).
* `prm_annual.csv`: Taken from the 2023 NERC LTRA (specifically the "Reference Margin Level (%)" reported for each reliability region)
