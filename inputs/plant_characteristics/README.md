### startcost.csv
Most startup costs are taken from Lew et al 2013 - Western Wind and Solar Integration Study Phase 2 [(NREL/TP-5500-55588)](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/55588.pdf). The original data, reported in $2011/MW in Table 7, are:
* Coal: 124
* Gas-CC: 81
* Gas-CT: 67
* Steam: 86
* Nuclear: 155
RPM uses 466 $2011/MW for nuclear, but we don't have a citable source for that number.
CCS startup costs are assumed to be the startup cost for the non-CCS version multiplied by the ratio of 2035 VOM costs between gas-cc-ccs and gas-cc in ATB 2023.
