*=========================================================
* --- EQUATIONS RELATING CAPACITY ACROSS TIME PERIODS ---
*=========================================================

*====================================
* -- existing capacity equations --
*====================================

$ontext

The following six equations dictate how capacity is represented in the model.

The first three equations handle init-X vintages (those that existed pre-2010)
which are bounded by m_capacity_exog. With retirements (in the second and third
equations), the constraints imply that capacity must be less than or
equal to m_capacity_exog and monotonically decreasing over time -
implying that if endogenous capacity was reduced in the previous year,
it cannot be brought back online.

New capacity, handled in equations four through six, is the sum of previous
years' greenfield investments and refurbishments. The same logic is present
for retiring capacity, the only difference being that contemporaneous
investment can increase the present-period's capacity.

Upgraded capacity reduces the total amount of capacity available to the
upgraded-from technology. For example, the model starts with 100MW of
coaloldscr (m_capacity_exog = 100) capacity then upgrades 10MW of that to
coaloldscr_coal-ccs capacity. The remaining amount of available coaloldscr
is thus 90 and coaloldscr_coal-ccs capacity is 10 but both are still less
than the 100 available. As time progresses and exogenous capacity declines,
the model chooses which units to take offline.
